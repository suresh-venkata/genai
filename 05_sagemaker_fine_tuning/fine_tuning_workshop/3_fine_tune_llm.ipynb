    "## Fine-tune model for better RAG\n",
    "In this notebook we will fine-tune the `Mistral 7B` model on the previously generated dataset. There are several reasons why we might want to fine-tune a model:\n",
    "- Our data is domain specific and is distinct from the data the model was trained on.\n",
    "- The model is not performing well on the task we are interested in.\n",
    "- We want to better align the models responses with our expectations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach\n",
    "We will follow a variation of the approach proposed in the Retrieval Augmented Fine Tuning [RAFT](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.10131). The main idea is we will create a fine-tuning dataset that is comprised of the question, relevant and irrelevant contexts, and the answer. We will then fine-tune the model on this dataset. The hope is that the model will learn to better distinguish between relevant and irrelevant contexts when formulating the response. This better simulates the real-world scenario where the retriever will likely return both relevant and irrelevant contexts and we need the model to be able to distinguish between the two.\n",
    "\n",
    "To speed up training, we will use the [unsloth](https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth) library combined with Hugging Face TRL as described in this [blog post](https://huggingface.co/blog/unsloth-trl). This would allows us to complete more fine-tuning within a limited amount of time than would have been possible in this environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Why combine RAG with fine-tuning?\n",
    "You may wonder why we are fine-tuning the model for RAG rather than fine-tuning on the question and answer task directly. One reason is that this approach trains the model to reason over our custom domain. This allows us to adapt the model to a wide variety of tasks besides question answering. For example, we could use the model to summarize specific regulations or extract entities. Another reason is that this approach would allows us to deal with changing documents without having to retrain the model. In our example the Banking Regulations change fairly frequently as we cas see in this [Timeline](https://www.ecfr.gov/recent-changes?search%5Bdate%5D=current&search%5Bhierarchy%5D%5Btitle%5D=12) view. It would be cost prohibitive and impractical to retrain the model every time the regulations change. However by tuning the model to reason over the documents, we can simply ingest the latest documents into the vector store and the model should be able to provide accurate and up to date answers.\n",
