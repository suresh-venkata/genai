In this notebook, we will walk through the process of obtaining a practical real world dataset and prepare it for downstream purposes including building a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline and fine tuning a large language model to improve the performance of the pipeline.\n",

    "### Usecase Overview\n",
    "The dataset we'll be using is comprised of [US Federal Banks and Banking Regulations](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-12). Our goal is to build a chatbot that will help users get answers to specific questions and understand the regulations and policies of the US Federal Banks. To simulate a real world scenario, we will obtain the raw data directly from the provided API and prepare it for downstream tasks. Once we have the data, we will build and evaluate an initial RAG pipeline and then proceed to improve on the pipeline by fine-tuning our own model."

    "### Synthetic Data Generation\n",
    "We have obtained some raw data that we can immediately use to build a RAG pipeline and fine-tune a model via [Continued Pre-training](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/custom-models.html). Continued pre-training would help domain adapt the model to specific vocabulary and context of the banking regulations, but not necessarily give it the ability to reason about and answer questions pertaining to the regulations. For that we need an instructions tuning dataset with examples of questions and answers pertaining to the regulations. Obtaining such a dataset can be expensive and time consuming as it requires domain experts to create the data. Instead we will synthetically generate a dataset of question and answer pairs using LLMs available on Amazon Bedrock.\n",

We can further refine and filter out synthetic data that is not relevant by enlisting subject matter experts (SMEs) by leveraging tools such as [SageMaker Ground Truth](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/groundtruth/). In summary, the advantages of synthetic data generation are:\n",
