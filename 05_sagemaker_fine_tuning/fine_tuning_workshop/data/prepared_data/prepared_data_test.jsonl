(Refer to section (b)(1))", "context": "\u00a7 330.10 Trust accounts.(a) Scope and definitions. This section governs coverage for deposits held in connection with informal revocable trusts, formal revocable trusts, and irrevocable trusts not covered by \u00a7 330.12 (\u201ctrust accounts\u201d). For purposes of this section:(1) Informal revocable trust means a trust under which a deposit passes directly to one or more beneficiaries upon the depositor's death without a written trust agreement, commonly referred to as a payable-on-death account, in-trust-for account, or Totten trust account.(2) Formal revocable trust means a revocable trust established by a written trust agreement under which a deposit passes to one or more beneficiaries upon the grantor's death.(3) Irrevocable trust means an irrevocable trust established by statute or a written trust agreement, except as described in paragraph (f) of this section.(b) Calculation of coverage\u2014(1) General calculation. Trust deposits are insured in an amount up to the SMDIA multiplied by the total number of beneficiaries identified by each grantor, up to a maximum of 5 beneficiaries.(2) Aggregation for purposes of insurance limit. Trust deposits that pass from the same grantor to beneficiaries are aggregated for purposes of determining coverage under this section, regardless of whether those deposits are held in connection with an informal revocable trust, formal revocable trust, or irrevocable trust.(3) Separate insurance coverage. The deposit insurance coverage provided under this section is separate from coverage provided for other deposits at the same insured depository institution.(4) Equal allocation presumed. Unless otherwise specified in the deposit account records of the insured depository institution, a deposit held in connection with a trust established by multiple grantors is presumed to have been owned or funded by the grantors in equal shares.(c) Number of beneficiaries. The total number of beneficiaries for a trust deposit under paragraph (b) of this section will be determined as follows:(1) Eligible beneficiaries. Subject to paragraph (c)(2) of this section, beneficiaries include natural persons, as well as charitable organizations and other non-profit entities recognized as such under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.(2) Ineligible beneficiaries. Beneficiaries do not include:(i) The grantor of a trust; or(ii) A person or entity that would only obtain an interest in the deposit if one or more identified beneficiaries are deceased.(3) Future trust(s) named as beneficiaries. If a trust agreement provides that trust funds will pass into one or more new trusts upon the death of the grantor(s) (\u201cfuture trusts\u201d), the future trust(s) are not treated as beneficiaries of the trust; rather, the future trust(s) are viewed as mechanisms for distributing trust funds, and the beneficiaries are the natural persons or organizations that shall receive the trust funds through the future trusts.(4) Informal trust account payable to depositor's formal trust. If an informal revocable trust designates the depositor's formal trust as its beneficiary, the informal revocable trust account will be treated as if titled in the name of the formal trust.(d) Deposit account records\u2014(1) Informal revocable trusts. The beneficiaries of an informal revocable trust must be specifically named in the deposit account records of the insured depository institution.(2) Formal revocable trusts. The title of a formal trust account must include terminology sufficient to identify the account as a trust account, such as \u201cfamily trust\u201d or \u201cliving trust,\u201d or must otherwise be identified as a testamentary trust in the account records of the insured depository institution. If eligible beneficiaries of such formal revocable trust are specifically named in the deposit account records of the insured depository institution, the FDIC shall presume the continued validity of the named beneficiary's interest in the trust consistent with \u00a7 330.5(a).(e) Commingled deposits of bankruptcy trustees. If a bankruptcy trustee appointed under title 11 of the United States Code commingles the funds of various bankruptcy estates in the same account at an insured depository institution, the funds of each title 11 bankruptcy estate will be added together and insured up to the SMDIA, separately from the funds of any other such estate.(f) Deposits excluded from coverage under this section\u2014(1) Revocable trust co-owners that are sole beneficiaries of a trust. If the co-owners of an informal or formal revocable trust are the trust's sole beneficiaries, deposits held in connection with the trust are treated as joint ownership deposits under \u00a7 330.9.(2) Employee benefit plan deposits. Deposits of employee benefit plans, even if held in connection with a trust, are treated as employee benefit plan deposits under \u00a7 330.14.(3) Investment company deposits. This section shall not apply to deposits of trust funds belonging to a trust classified as a corporation under \u00a7 330.11(a)(2).(4) Insured depository institution as trustee of an irrevocable trust. Deposits held by an insured depository institution in its capacity as trustee of an irrevocable trust are insured as provided in \u00a7 330.12.[87 FR 4470, Jan. 28, 2022] ", "section_metadata": {"chapter_title": "CHAPTER III\u2014FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION", "chapter_id": "III", "volume_title": "PART 330\u2014DEPOSIT INSURANCE COVERAGE", "volume_id": "330", "section_id": "330.10", "section_title": "\u00a7 330.10 Trust accounts.", "unique_id": "III.330.10"}}

A Board-regulated institution may recognize the credit risk mitigation benefits of a guarantee or credit derivative covering an exposure described in \u00a7 217.134(a)(1) by applying the double default treatment in this section if all the following criteria are satisfied:(1) The hedged exposure is fully covered or covered on a pro rata basis by:(i) An eligible guarantee issued by an eligible double default guarantor; or(ii) An eligible credit derivative that meets the requirements of \u00a7 217.134(b)(2) and that is issued by an eligible double default guarantor.(2) The guarantee or credit derivative is:(i) An uncollateralized guarantee or uncollateralized credit derivative (for example, a credit default swap) that provides protection with respect to a single reference obligor; or(ii) An n th-to-default credit derivative (subject to the requirements of \u00a7 217.142(m).(3) The hedged exposure is a wholesale exposure (other than a sovereign exposure).(4) The obligor of the hedged exposure is not:(i) An eligible double default guarantor or an affiliate of an eligible double default guarantor; or(ii) An affiliate of the guarantor.(5) The Board-regulated institution does not recognize any credit risk mitigation benefits of the guarantee or credit derivative for the hedged exposure other than through application of the double default treatment as provided in this section.(6) The Board-regulated institution has implemented a process (which has received the prior, written approval of the Board) to detect excessive correlation between the creditworthiness of the obligor of the hedged exposure and the protection provider. If excessive correlation is present, the Board-regulated institution may not use the double default treatment for the hedged exposure.(b) Full coverage. If a transaction meets the criteria in paragraph (a) of this section and the protection amount (P) of the guarantee or credit derivative is at least equal to the EAD of the hedged exposure, the Board-regulated institution may determine its risk-weighted asset amount for the hedged exposure under paragraph (e) of this section.(c) Partial coverage. If a transaction meets the criteria in paragraph (a) of this section and the protection amount (P) of the guarantee or credit derivative is less than the EAD of the hedged exposure, the Board-regulated institution must treat the hedged exposure as two separate exposures (protected and unprotected) in order to recognize double default treatment on the protected portion of the exposure:(1) For the protected exposure, the Board-regulated institution must set EAD equal to P and calculate its risk-weighted asset amount as provided in paragraph (e) of this section; and(2) For the unprotected exposure, the Board-regulated institution must set EAD equal to the EAD of the original exposure minus P and then calculate its risk-weighted asset amount as provided in \u00a7 217.131.(d) Mismatches. For any hedged exposure to which a Board-regulated institution applies double default treatment under this part, the Board-regulated institution must make applicable adjustments to the protection amount as required in \u00a7 217.134(d), (e), and (f).(e) The double default dollar risk-based capital requirement. The dollar risk-based capital requirement for a hedged exposure to which a Board-regulated institution has applied double default treatment is KDD multiplied by the EAD of the exposure.

It is understood that similar joint accounts are not uncommon, and it appears that the margin requirements of the regulation are not consistently applied to extensions of credit in the accounts.(b) When the account in question was opened, Firm Y deposited $5,000 with Firm X and has made no further deposit in the account, except for the monthly settlement described below. Both firms have the privilege of buying and selling specified securities in the account, but it appears that Firm X initiates most of the transactions therein. Trading volume may run from half a million to a million dollars a month. Firm X carries the \u201cofficial\u201d ledger of the account and sends Firm Y a monthly statement with a complete record of all transactions effected during the month.

However, all transactions are confirmed and reconfirmed between the two on a daily basis.(c) Section 220.3(a) provides thatAll financial relations between a creditor and a customer, whether recorded in one record or in more than one record, shall be included in and be deemed to be part of the customer's general account with the creditor, * * *.and \u00a7 220.2(c) defines the term \u201ccustomer\u201d to include * * * any person, or any group of persons acting jointly, * * * to or for whom a creditor is extending or maintaining any credit * * *In the course of a normal month's operations, both Firm X and Firm Y are at one time or another extending credit to the joint account, since both make purchases for the account that are not \u201csettled\u201d until the month's end. Consequently, the account would be a \u201ccustomer\u201d within the above definition. (d) Section 220.6(b) provides, with respect to the account of a joint adventure in which a creditor participates, that* * * the adjusted debit balance of the account shall include, in addition to the items specified in \u00a7 220.3(d), any amount by which the creditor's contribution to the joint adventure exceeds the contribution which he would have made if he had contributed merely in proportion to his right to share in the profits of the joint adventure.In addition, the final paragraph of \u00a7 220.2(c) states that the definition of \u201ccustomer\u201d * * * includes any joint adventure in which a creditor participates and which would be considered a customer of the creditor if the creditor were not a participant.(e) The above provisions clearly evince the Board's intent that the regulation shall cover trading accounts in which a creditor participates.

During the course of the Board's consideration of this amendment several questions arose as to the scope of such activity, particularly in view of certain restrictions imposed by sections 16, 20, 21, and 32 of the Banking Act of 1933 (12 U.S.C. 24, 377, 378, 78) (sometimes referred to hereinafter as the \u201cGlass-Steagall Act provisions\u201d) and the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Investment Company Institute v. Camp, 401 U.S. 617 (1971). The Board's views with respect to some of these questions are set forth below.(b) It is clear from the legislative history of the Bank Holding Company Act Amendments of 1970 (84 Stat. 1760) that the Glass-Steagall Act provisions were not intended to be affected thereby. Accordingly, the Board regards the Glass-Steagall Act provisions and the Board's prior interpretations thereof as applicable to a holding company's activities as an investment adviser. Consistently with the spirit and purpose of the Glass-Steagall Act, this interpretation applies to all bank holding companies registered under the Bank Holding Company Act irrespective of whether they have subsidiaries that are member banks.(c) Under \u00a7 225.4(a)(5), as amended, bank holding companies (which term, as used herein, includes both their bank and nonbank subsidiaries) may, in accordance with the provisions of \u00a7 225.4 (b), act as investment advisers to various types of investment companies, such as \u201copen-end\u201d investment companies (commonly referred to as \u201cmutual funds\u201d) and \u201cclosed-end\u201d investment companies. Briefly, a mutual fund is an investment company which, typically, is continuously engaged in the issuance of its shares and stands ready at any time to redeem the securities as to which it is the issuer; a closed-end investment company typically does not issue shares after its initial organization except at infrequent intervals and does not stand ready to redeem its shares.(d) The Board intends that a bank holding company may exercise all functions that are permitted to be exercised by an \u201cinvestment adviser\u201d under the Investment Company Act of 1940, except to the extent limited by the Glass-Steagall Act provisions, as described, in part, hereinafter.(e) The Board recognizes that presently most mutual funds are organized, sponsored and managed by investment advisers with which they are affiliated and that their securities are distributed to the public by such affiliated investment advisers, or subsidiaries or affiliates thereof. However, the Board believes that (1) The Glass-Steagall Act provisions do not permit a bank holding company to perform all such functions, and (2) It is not necessary for a bank holding company to perform all such functions in order to engage effectively in the described activity.(f) In the Board's opinion, the Glass-Steagall Act provisions, as interpreted by the U.S. Supreme Court, forbid a bank holding company to sponsor, organize, or control a mutual fund. However, the Board does not believe that such restrictions apply to closed-end investment companies as long as such companies are not primarily or frequently engaged in the issuance, sale, and distribution of securities. A bank holding company should not act as investment adviser to an investment company that has a name similar to the name of the holding company or any of its subsidiary banks, unless the prospectus of the investment company contains the disclosures required in paragraph (h) of this section. In no case should a bank holding company act as investment adviser to an investment company that has either the same name as the name of the holding company or any of its subsidiary banks, or a name that contains the word \u201cbank.\u201d(g) In view of the potential conflicts of interests that may exist, a bank holding company and its bank and nonbank subsidiaries should not purchase in their sole discretion, in a fiduciary capacity (including as managing agent), securities of any investment company for which the bank holding company acts as investment adviser unless, the purchase is specifically authorized by the terms of the instrument creating the fiduciary relationship, by court order, or by the law of the jurisdiction under which the trust is administered.(h) Under section 20 of the Glass-Steagall Act, a member bank is prohibited from being affiliated with a company that directly, or through a subsidiary, engages principally in the issue, flotation, underwriting, public sale, or distribution of securities. A bank holding company or its nonbank subsidiary may not engage, directly or indirectly, in the underwriting, public sale or distribution of securities of any investment company for which the holding company or any nonbank subsidiary provides investment advice except in compliance with the terms of section 20, and only after obtaining the Board's approval under section 4 of the Bank Holding Company Act and subject to the limitations and disclosures required by the Board in those cases. The Board has determined, however, that the conduct of securities brokerage activities by a bank holding company or its nonbank subsidiaries, when conducted individually or in combination with investment advisory activities, is not deemed to be the underwriting, public sale, or distribution of securities prohibited by the Glass-Steagall Act, and the U.S. Supreme Court has upheld that determination. See Securities Industry Ass'n v. Board of Governors, 468 U.S. 207 (1984); see also Securities Industry Ass'n v. Board of Governors, 821 F.2d 810 (D.C. Cir. 1987), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 1005 (1988). Accordingly, the Board believes that a bank holding company or any of its nonbank subsidiaries that has been authorized by the Board under the Bank Holding Company Act to conduct securities brokerage activities (either separately or in combination with investment advisory activities) may act as agent, upon the order and for the account of customers of the holding company or its nonbank subsidiary, to purchase or sell shares of an investment company for which the bank holding company or any of its subsidiaries acts as an investment adviser. In addition, a bank holding company or any of its nonbank subsidiaries that has been authorized by the Board under the Bank Holding Company Act to provide investment advice to third parties generally (either separately or in combination with securities brokerage services) may provide investment advice to customers with respect to the purchase or sale of shares of an investment company for which the holding company or any of its subsidiaries acts as an investment adviser. In the event that a bank holding company or any of its nonbank subsidiaries provides brokerage or investment advisory services (either separately or in combination) to customers in the situations described above, at the time the service is provided the bank holding company should instruct its officers and employees to caution customers to read the prospectus of the investment company before investing and must advise customers in writing that the investment company's shares are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and are not deposits, obligations of, or endorsed or guaranteed in any way by, any bank, unless that happens to be the case. The holding company or nonbank subsidiary must also disclose in writing to the customer the role of the company or affiliate as adviser to the investment company. These disclosures may be made orally so long as written disclosure is provided to the customer immediately thereafter. To the extent that a bank owned by a bank holding company engages in providing advisory or brokerage services to bank customers in connection with an investment company advised by the bank holding company or a nonbank affiliate, but is not required by the bank's primary regulator to make disclosures comparable to the disclosures required to be made by bank holding companies providing such services, the bank holding company should require its subsidiary bank to make the disclosures required in this paragraph to be made by a bank holding company that provides such advisory or brokerage services.(i) Acting in such capacities as registrar, transfer agent, or custodian for an investment company is not a selling activity and is permitted under \u00a7 225.4(a)(4) of Regulation Y. However, in view of potential conflicts of interests, a bank holding company which acts both as custodian and investment adviser for an investment company should exercise care to maintain at a minimal level demand deposit accounts of the investment company which are placed with a bank affiliate and should not invest cash funds of the investment company in time deposit accounts (including certificates of deposit) of any bank affiliate.[37 FR 1464, Jan. 29, 1972, as amended by Reg.

The facts indicated that the applicant company had incurred debt for the purpose of acquiring bank shares and immediately after the purchase the shares were transferred to an unaffiliated escrow agent with instructions to retain possession of the shares pending Board action on the company's application to become a bank holding company. The escrow agreement provided that, if the application were approved by the Board, the escrow agent was to return the shares to the applicant company; and, if the application were denied, the escrow agent was to deliver the shares to the applicant company's shareholders upon their assumption of debt originally incurred by the applicant in the acquisition of the bank shares. In addition, the escrow agreement provided that, while the shares were held in escrow, the applicant could not exercise voting or any other ownership rights with respect to those shares.(b) On the basis of the above facts, the Board concluded that the company had violated the prior approval provisions of section 3 of the Bank Holding Company Act (\u201cAct\u201d) at the time that it made the initial acquisition of bank shares and that, for purposes of the Act, the company continued to control those shares in violation of the Act. In view of these findings, individuals and bank holding companies should not enter into escrow arrangements of the type described herein, or any similar arrangement, without securing the prior approval of the Board, since such action could constitute a violation of the Act.(c) While the above represents the Board's conclusion with respect to the particular escrow arrangement involved in the proposal presented, the Board does not believe that the use of an escrow arrangement would always result in a violation of the Act. For example, it appears that a transaction whereby bank shares are placed in escrow pending Board action on an application would not involve a violation of the Act so long as title to such shares remains with the seller during the pendency of the application; there are no other indicia that the applicant controls the shares held in escrow; and, in the event of a Board denial of the application, the escrow agreement provides that the shares would be returned to the seller.[41 FR 9859, Mar. 8, 1976, as amended at 41 FR 12009, Mar. 23, 1976] ", "section_metadata": {"chapter_title": "CHAPTER II\u2014FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM", "chapter_id": "II", "volume_title": "PART 225\u2014BANK HOLDING COMPANIES AND CHANGE IN BANK CONTROL (REGULATION Y)", "volume_id": "225", "section_id": "225.134", "section_title": "\u00a7 225.134 Escrow arrangements involving bank stock resulting in a violation of the Bank Holding Company Act.", "unique_id": "II.225.134"}}

A national bank director must own a qualifying equity interest in a national bank or a company that has control of a national bank. The director must own the qualifying equity interest in his or her own right and meet a certain minimum threshold ownership.(b) Qualifying equity interest\u2014(1) Minimum required equity interest. For purposes of this section, a qualifying equity interest includes common or preferred stock of the bank or of a company that controls the bank that has not less than an aggregate par value of $1,000, an aggregate shareholders' equity of $1,000, or an aggregate fair market value of $1,000.(i) The value of the common or preferred stock held by a national bank director is valued as of the date purchased or the date on which the individual became a director, whichever value is greater.(ii) In the case of a company that owns more than one national bank, a director may use his or her equity interest in the controlling company to satisfy, in whole or in part, the equity interest requirement for any or all of the controlled national banks.(iii) Upon request, the OCC may consider whether other interests in a company controlling a national bank constitute an interest equivalent to $1,000 par value of national bank stock.(2) Joint ownership and tenancy in common. Shares held jointly or as a tenant in common are qualifying shares held by a director in his or her own right only to the extent of the aggregate value of the shares which the director would be entitled to receive on dissolution of the joint tenancy or tenancy in common.(3) Shares in a living trust. Shares deposited by a person in a living trust (inter vivos trust) as to which the person is a trustee and retains an absolute power of revocation are shares owned by the person in his or her own right.(4) Other arrangements\u2014(i) Shares held through retirement plans and similar arrangements. A director may hold his or her qualifying interest through a profit-sharing plan, individual retirement account, retirement plan, or similar arrangement, if the director retains beneficial ownership and legal control over the shares.(ii) Shares held subject to buyback agreements. A director may acquire and hold his or her qualifying interest pursuant to a stock repurchase or buyback agreement with a transferring shareholder under which the director purchases the qualifying shares subject to an agreement that the transferring shareholder will repurchase the shares when, for any reason, the director ceases to serve in that capacity. The agreement may give the transferring shareholder a right of first refusal to repurchase the qualifying shares if the director seeks to transfer ownership of the shares to a third person.(iii) Assignment of right to dividends or distributions. A director may assign the right to receive all dividends or distributions on his or her qualifying shares to another, including a transferring shareholder, if the director retains beneficial ownership and legal control over the shares.(iv) Execution of proxy. A director may execute a revocable or irrevocable proxy authorizing another, including a transferring shareholder, to vote his or her qualifying shares, provided the director retains beneficial ownership and legal control over the shares.(c) Non-qualifying ownership. The following are not shares held by a director in his or her own right:(1) Shares pledged by the holder to secure a loan. However, all or part of the funds used to purchase the required qualifying equity interest may be borrowed from any party, including the bank or its affiliates;(2) Shares purchased subject to an absolute option vested in the seller to repurchase the shares within a specified period; and(3) Shares deposited in a voting trust where the depositor surrenders:(i) Legal ownership (depositor ceases to be registered owner of the stock);(ii) Power to vote the stock or to direct how it must be voted; or(iii) Power to transfer legal title to the stock.[61 FR 4862, Feb. 9, 1996, as amended at 64 FR 60099, Nov. 4, 1999; 85 FR 83734, Dec. 22, 2020] ", "section_metadata": {"chapter_title": "CHAPTER I\u2014COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY, DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY", "chapter_id": "I", "volume_title": "PART 7\u2014ACTIVITIES AND OPERATIONS", "volume_id": "7", "section_id": "7.2005", "section_title": "\u00a7 7.2005 Ownership of stock necessary to qualify as director of a national bank.", "unique_id": "I.7.2005"}}

A sponsor satisfies the risk retention requirements of \u00a7 373.3 with respect to an open market CLO transaction if:(1) The open market CLO does not acquire or hold any assets other than CLO-eligible loan tranches that meet the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section and servicing assets;(2) The governing documents of such open market CLO require that, at all times, the assets of the open market CLO consist of senior, secured syndicated loans that are CLO-eligible loan tranches and servicing assets;(3) The open market CLO does not invest in ABS interests or in credit derivatives other than hedging transactions that are servicing assets to hedge risks of the open market CLO;(4) All purchases of CLO-eligible loan tranches and other assets by the open market CLO issuing entity or through a warehouse facility used to accumulate the loans prior to the issuance of the CLO's ABS interests are made in open market transactions on an arms-length basis;(5) The CLO manager of the open market CLO is not entitled to receive any management fee or gain on sale at the time the open market CLO issues its ABS interests.(c) CLO-eligible loan tranche. To qualify as a CLO-eligible loan tranche, a term loan of a syndicated credit facility to a commercial borrower must have the following features:(1) A minimum of 5 percent of the face amount of the CLO-eligible loan tranche is retained by the lead arranger thereof until the earliest of the repayment, maturity, involuntary and unscheduled acceleration, payment default, or bankruptcy default of such CLO-eligible loan tranche, provided that such lead arranger complies with limitations on hedging, transferring and pledging in \u00a7 373.12 with respect to the interest retained by the lead arranger.(2) Lender voting rights within the credit agreement and any intercreditor or other applicable agreements governing such CLO-eligible loan tranche are defined so as to give holders of the CLO-eligible loan tranche consent rights with respect to, at minimum, any material waivers and amendments of such applicable documents, including but not limited to, adverse changes to the calculation or payments of amounts due to the holders of the CLO-eligible tranche, alterations to pro rata provisions, changes to voting provisions, and waivers of conditions precedent; and(3) The pro rata provisions, voting provisions, and similar provisions applicable to the security associated with such CLO-eligible loan tranches under the CLO credit agreement and any intercreditor or other applicable agreements governing such CLO-eligible loan tranches are not materially less advantageous to the holder(s) of such CLO-eligible tranche than the terms of other tranches of comparable seniority in the broader syndicated credit facility.(d) Disclosures. A sponsor relying on this section shall provide, or cause to be provided, to potential investors a reasonable period of time prior to the sale of the asset-backed securities in the securitization transaction and at least annually with respect to the information required by paragraph (d)(1) of this section and, upon request, to the Commission and its appropriate Federal banking agency, if any, the following disclosure in written form under the caption \u201cCredit Risk Retention\u201d:(1) Open market CLOs. A complete list of every asset held by an open market CLO (or before the CLO's closing, in a warehouse facility in anticipation of transfer into the CLO at closing), including the following information:(i) The full legal name, Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) category code, and legal entity identifier (LEI) issued by a utility endorsed or otherwise governed by the Global LEI Regulatory Oversight Committee or the Global LEI Foundation (if an LEI has been obtained by the obligor) of the obligor of the loan or asset;(ii) The full name of the specific loan tranche held by the CLO;(iii) The face amount of the entire loan tranche held by the CLO, and the face amount of the portion thereof held by the CLO;(iv) The price at which the loan tranche was acquired by the CLO; and(v) For each loan tranche, the full legal name of the lead arranger subject to the sales and hedging restrictions of \u00a7 373.12; and(2) CLO manager.

This clarifies the Board's intent that, to qualify for special treatment under that section, the lender must stand in a special employer-employee relationship with the borrower, and a special relationship of issuer with regard to the collateral. The fact that the Board, for convenience and practical reasons, permitted the employing corporation to act through a subsidiary or other entity should not be interpreted to mean the Board intended the lender to be other than an entity whose overriding interests were coextensive with the issuer.

The calculation of KIRB must reflect the effects of any credit risk mitigant applied to the underlying exposures.", "context": "\u00a7 324.143 Supervisory formula approach (SFA).(a) Eligibility requirements. An FDIC-supervised institution must use the SFA to determine its risk-weighted asset amount for a securitization exposure if the FDIC-supervised institution can calculate on an ongoing basis each of the SFA parameters in paragraph (e) of this section.(b) Mechanics. The risk-weighted asset amount for a securitization exposure equals its SFA risk-based capital requirement as calculated under paragraph (c) and (d) of this section, multiplied by 12.5.(c) The SFA risk-based capital requirement. (1) If KIRB is greater than or equal to L + T, an exposure's SFA risk-based capital requirement equals the exposure amount.(2) If KIRB is less than or equal to L, an exposure's SFA risk-based capital requirement is UE multiplied by TP multiplied by the greater of:(i) F \u00b7 T (where F is 0.016 for all securitization exposures); or(ii) S[L + T] \u2212 S[L].(3) If KIRB is greater than L and less than L + T, the FDIC-supervised institution must apply a 1,250 percent risk weight to an amount equal to UE \u00b7 TP \u00b7 (KIRB \u2212 L), and the exposure's SFA risk-based capital requirement is UE multiplied by TP multiplied by the greater of:(i) F \u00b7 (T \u2212 (KIRB \u2212 L)) (where F is 0.016 for all other securitization exposures); or(ii) S[L + T] \u2212 S[KIRB].(d) The supervisory formula:(e) SFA parameters. For purposes of the calculations in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section:(1) Amount of the underlying exposures (UE). UE is the EAD of any underlying exposures that are wholesale and retail exposures (including the amount of any funded spread accounts, cash collateral accounts, and other similar funded credit enhancements) plus the amount of any underlying exposures that are securitization exposures (as defined in \u00a7 324.142(e)) plus the adjusted carrying value of any underlying exposures that are equity exposures (as defined in \u00a7 324.151(b)).(2) Tranche percentage (TP). TP is the ratio of the amount of the FDIC-supervised institution's securitization exposure to the amount of the tranche that contains the securitization exposure.(3) Capital requirement on underlying exposures (KIRB). (i) KIRB is the ratio of:(A) The sum of the risk-based capital requirements for the underlying exposures plus the expected credit losses of the underlying exposures (as determined under this subpart E as if the underlying exposures were directly held by the FDIC-supervised institution); to(B) UE.(ii) The calculation of KIRB must reflect the effects of any credit risk mitigant applied to the underlying exposures (either to an individual underlying exposure, to a group of underlying exposures, or to all of the underlying exposures).(iii) All assets related to the securitization are treated as underlying exposures, including assets in a reserve account (such as a cash collateral account).(4) Credit enhancement level (L). (i) L is the ratio of:(A) The amount of all securitization exposures subordinated to the tranche that contains the FDIC-supervised institution's securitization exposure; to(B) UE.(ii) An FDIC-supervised institution must determine L before considering the effects of any tranche-specific credit enhancements.(iii) Any gain-on-sale or CEIO associated with the securitization may not be included in L.(iv) Any reserve account funded by accumulated cash flows from the underlying exposures that is subordinated to the tranche that contains the FDIC-supervised institution's securitization exposure may be included in the numerator and denominator of L to the extent cash has accumulated in the account. Unfunded reserve accounts (that is, reserve accounts that are to be funded from future cash flows from the underlying exposures) may not be included in the calculation of L.(v) In some cases, the purchase price of receivables will reflect a discount that provides credit enhancement (for example, first loss protection) for all or certain tranches of the securitization. When this arises, L should be calculated inclusive of this discount if the discount provides credit enhancement for the securitization exposure.(5) Thickness of tranche (T). T is the ratio of:(i) The amount of the tranche that contains the FDIC-supervised institution's securitization exposure; to(ii) UE.(6) Effective number of exposures (N). (i) Unless the FDIC-supervised institution elects to use the formula provided in paragraph (f) of this section,where EADi represents the EAD associated with the i th instrument in the underlying exposures.(ii) Multiple exposures to one obligor must be treated as a single underlying exposure.(iii) In the case of a resecuritization, the FDIC-supervised institution must treat each underlying exposure as a single underlying exposure and must not look through to the originally securitized underlying exposures.(7) Exposure-weighted average loss given default (EWALGD). EWALGD is calculated as:where LGDi represents the average LGD associated with all exposures to the i th obligor. In the case of a resecuritization, an LGD of 100 percent must be assumed for the underlying exposures that are themselves securitization exposures.(f) Simplified method for computing N and EWALGD. (1) If all underlying exposures of a securitization are retail exposures, an FDIC-supervised institution may apply the SFA using the following simplifications:(i) h = 0; and(ii) v = 0.(2) Under the conditions in \u00a7\u00a7 324.143(f)(3) and (f)(4), an FDIC-supervised institution may employ a simplified method for calculating N and EWALGD.(3) If C1 is no more than 0.03, an FDIC-supervised institution may set EWALGD = 0.50 if none of the underlying exposures is a securitization exposure, or may set EWALGD = 1 if one or more of the underlying exposures is a securitization exposure, and may set N equal to the following amount:where: (i) Cm is the ratio of the sum of the amounts of the `m' largest underlying exposures to UE; and (ii) The level of m is to be selected by the FDIC-supervised institution.(4) Alternatively, if only C1 is available and C1 is no more than 0.03, the FDIC-supervised institution may set EWALGD = 0.50 if none of the underlying exposures is a securitization exposure, or may set EWALGD = 1 if one or more of the underlying exposures is a securitization exposure and may set N = 1/C1.", "section_metadata": {"chapter_title": "CHAPTER III\u2014FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION", "chapter_id": "III", "volume_title": "PART 324\u2014CAPITAL ADEQUACY OF FDIC-SUPERVISED INSTITUTIONS", "volume_id": "324", "section_id": "324.143", "section_title": "\u00a7 324.143 Supervisory formula approach (SFA).", "unique_id": "III.324.143"}}

(Regulation text: \u00a7 238.92(a)(2))", "context": "\u00a7 238.92 Definitions.For purposes of this subpart, the following definitions apply:(a) Affiliate. (1) The term affiliate has the meaning given in section 202 of the Interlocks Act (12 U.S.C. 3201).

In making this determination, the Board considers, among other things, whether a person, including members of his or her immediate family, whose shares are necessary to constitute the group owns a nominal percentage of the shares of one of the organizations and the percentage is substantially disproportionate to that person's ownership of shares in the other organization.(b) Area median income means:(1) The median family income for the metropolitan statistical area (MSA), if a depository organization is located in an MSA; or(2) The statewide nonmetropolitan median family income, if a depository organization is located outside an MSA.(c) Community means a city, town, or village, and contiguous or adjacent cities, towns, or villages.(d) Contiguous or adjacent cities, towns, or villages means cities, towns, or villages whose borders touch each other or whose borders are within 10 road miles of each other at their closest points.

The Board will find that a person has an obligation to act on behalf of another person only if the first person has an agreement, express or implied, to act on behalf of the second person with respect to management responsibilities. The Board will determine, after giving the affected persons an opportunity to respond, whether a person is a representative or nominee.(o) Savings association means:(1) Any Federal savings association (as defined in section 3(b)(2) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1813(b)(2)));(2) Any state savings association (as defined in section 3(b)(3) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1813(b)(3))) the deposits of which are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation; and(3) Any corporation (other than a bank as defined in section 3(a)(1) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1813(a)(1))) the deposits of which are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, that the Board of Directors of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Comptroller of the Currency jointly determine to be operating in substantially the same manner as a savings association.(p) Total assets.

Notwithstanding paragraph (p)(1) of this section, from December 2, 2020, through December 31, 2021, for purposes of this subpart J, the term total assets, with respect to a depository organization, means the lesser of assets of the depository organization reported on a consolidated basis as of December 31, 2019, and assets reported on a consolidated basis as of the end of the most recent fiscal year. The relief provided under this paragraph (p)(3) does not apply to a depository organization if the Board determines that permitting the depository organization to determine its assets in accordance with that paragraph would not be commensurate with the risk profile of the depository organization. When making this determination, the Board will consider all relevant factors, including the extent of asset growth of the depository organization since December 31, 2019; the causes of such growth, including whether growth occurred as a result of mergers or acquisitions; whether such growth is likely to be temporary or permanent; whether the depository organization has become involved in any additional activities since December 31, 2019; the asset size of any parent companies; and the type of assets held by the depository organization.

A Board-regulated institution must use one or more internal models to calculate daily a VaR-based measure of the general market risk of all covered positions. The daily VaR-based measure also may reflect the Board-regulated institution's specific risk for one or more portfolios of debt and equity positions, if the internal models meet the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of \u00a7 217.207. The daily VaR-based measure must also reflect the Board-regulated institution's specific risk for any portfolio of correlation trading positions that is modeled under \u00a7 217.209. A Board-regulated institution may elect to include term repo-style transactions in its VaR-based measure, provided that the Board-regulated institution includes all such term repo-style transactions consistently over time.(1) The Board-regulated institution's internal models for calculating its VaR-based measure must use risk factors sufficient to measure the market risk inherent in all covered positions. The market risk categories must include, as appropriate, interest rate risk, credit spread risk, equity price risk, foreign exchange risk, and commodity price risk. For material positions in the major currencies and markets, modeling techniques must incorporate enough segments of the yield curve\u2014in no case less than six\u2014to capture differences in volatility and less than perfect correlation of rates along the yield curve.(2) The VaR-based measure may incorporate empirical correlations within and across risk categories, provided the Board-regulated institution validates and demonstrates the reasonableness of its process for measuring correlations. If the VaR-based measure does not incorporate empirical correlations across risk categories, the Board-regulated institution must add the separate measures from its internal models used to calculate the VaR-based measure for the appropriate market risk categories (interest rate risk, credit spread risk, equity price risk, foreign exchange rate risk, and/or commodity price risk) to determine its aggregate VaR-based measure.(3) The VaR-based measure must include the risks arising from the nonlinear price characteristics of options positions or positions with embedded optionality and the sensitivity of the fair value of the positions to changes in the volatility of the underlying rates, prices, or other material risk factors. A Board-regulated institution with a large or complex options portfolio must measure the volatility of options positions or positions with embedded optionality by different maturities and/or strike prices, where material.(4) The Board-regulated institution must be able to justify to the satisfaction of the Board the omission of any risk factors from the calculation of its VaR-based measure that the Board-regulated institution uses in its pricing models.(5) The Board-regulated institution must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Board the appropriateness of any proxies used to capture the risks of the Board-regulated institution's actual positions for which such proxies are used.(b) Quantitative requirements for VaR-based measure. (1) The VaR-based measure must be calculated on a daily basis using a one-tail, 99.0 percent confidence level, and a holding period equivalent to a 10-business-day movement in underlying risk factors, such as rates, spreads, and prices. To calculate VaR-based measures using a 10-business-day holding period, the Board-regulated institution may calculate 10-business-day measures directly or may convert VaR-based measures using holding periods other than 10 business days to the equivalent of a 10-business-day holding period. A Board-regulated institution that converts its VaR-based measure in such a manner must be able to justify the reasonableness of its approach to the satisfaction of the Board.(2) The VaR-based measure must be based on a historical observation period of at least one year. Data used to determine the VaR-based measure must be relevant to the Board-regulated institution's actual exposures and of sufficient quality to support the calculation of risk-based capital requirements. The Board-regulated institution must update data sets at least monthly or more frequently as changes in market conditions or portfolio composition warrant. For a Board-regulated institution that uses a weighting scheme or other method for the historical observation period, the Board-regulated institution must either:(i) Use an effective observation period of at least one year in which the average time lag of the observations is at least six months; or(ii) Demonstrate to the Board that its weighting scheme is more effective than a weighting scheme with an average time lag of at least six months representing the volatility of the Board-regulated institution's trading portfolio over a full business cycle. A Board-regulated institution using this option must update its data more frequently than monthly and in a manner appropriate for the type of weighting scheme.(c) A Board-regulated institution must divide its portfolio into a number of significant subportfolios approved by the Board for subportfolio backtesting purposes. These subportfolios must be sufficient to allow the Board-regulated institution and the Board to assess the adequacy of the VaR model at the risk factor level; the Board will evaluate the appropriateness of these subportfolios relative to the value and composition of the Board-regulated institution's covered positions. The Board-regulated institution must retain and make available to the Board the following information for each subportfolio for each business day over the previous two years (500 business days), with no more than a 60-day lag:(1) A daily VaR-based measure for the subportfolio calibrated to a one-tail, 99.0 percent confidence level;(2) The daily profit or loss for the subportfolio (that is, the net change in price of the positions held in the portfolio at the end of the previous business day); and(3) The p-value of the profit or loss on each day (that is, the probability of observing a profit that is less than, or a loss that is greater than, the amount reported for purposes of paragraph (c)(2) of this section based on the model used to calculate the VaR-based measure described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section).", "section_metadata": {"chapter_title": "CHAPTER II\u2014FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM", "chapter_id": "II", "volume_title": "PART 217\u2014CAPITAL ADEQUACY OF BANK HOLDING COMPANIES, SAVINGS AND LOAN HOLDING COMPANIES, AND STATE MEMBER BANKS (REGULATION Q)", "volume_id": "217", "section_id": "217.205", "section_title": "\u00a7 217.205 VaR-based measure.", "unique_id": "II.217.205"}}

The risk-weighted asset amount of the effective portion of the hedge pair is equal to its adjusted carrying value.(b) Full look-through approach. A national bank or Federal savings association that is able to calculate a risk-weighted asset amount for its proportional ownership share of each exposure held by the investment fund (as calculated under this subpart E of this part as if the proportional ownership share of each exposure were held directly by the national bank or Federal savings association) may either:(1) Set the risk-weighted asset amount of the national bank's or Federal savings association's exposure to the fund equal to the product of:(i) The aggregate risk-weighted asset amounts of the exposures held by the fund as if they were held directly by the national bank or Federal savings association; and(ii) The national bank's or Federal savings association's proportional ownership share of the fund; or(2) Include the national bank's or Federal savings association's proportional ownership share of each exposure held by the fund in the national bank's or Federal savings association's IMA.(c) Simple modified look-through approach. Under this approach, the risk-weighted asset amount for a national bank's or Federal savings association's equity exposure to an investment fund equals the adjusted carrying value of the equity exposure multiplied by the highest risk weight assigned according to subpart D of this part that applies to any exposure the fund is permitted to hold under its prospectus, partnership agreement, or similar contract that defines the fund's permissible investments (excluding derivative contracts that are used for hedging rather than speculative purposes and that do not constitute a material portion of the fund's exposures).(d) Alternative modified look-through approach. Under this approach, a national bank or Federal savings association may assign the adjusted carrying value of an equity exposure to an investment fund on a pro rata basis to different risk weight categories assigned according to subpart D of this part based on the investment limits in the fund's prospectus, partnership agreement, or similar contract that defines the fund's permissible investments. The risk-weighted asset amount for the national bank's or Federal savings association's equity exposure to the investment fund equals the sum of each portion of the adjusted carrying value assigned to an exposure class multiplied by the applicable risk weight. If the sum of the investment limits for all exposure types within the fund exceeds 100 percent, the national bank or Federal savings association must assume that the fund invests to the maximum extent permitted under its investment limits in the exposure type with the highest risk weight under subpart D of this part, and continues to make investments in order of the exposure type with the next highest risk weight under subpart D of this part until the maximum total investment level is reached. If more than one exposure type applies to an exposure, the national bank or Federal savings association must use the highest applicable risk weight.

This subpart establishes a framework for assessing overall risk-based capital for Board-regulated institutions that are significantly engaged in insurance activities. The framework in this subpart is used to measure available capital resources and capital requirements across a Board-regulated institution and its subsidiaries that are subject to diverse capital frameworks, aggregate available capital resources and capital requirements and calculate a ratio that reflects the overall capital adequacy of the Board-regulated institution.(b) Applicability. This subpart applies to every Board-regulated institution that is:(1) A top-tier depository institution holding company that is an insurance underwriting company; or(2) A top-tier depository institution holding company, that, as of June 30 of the previous calendar year, held 25 percent or more of its total consolidated assets in insurance underwriting companies (other than assets associated with insurance underwriting for credit risk). For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2), the Board-regulated institution must calculate its total consolidated assets in accordance with GAAP, or if the Board-regulated institution does not calculate its total consolidated assets under GAAP for any regulatory purpose (including compliance with applicable securities laws), the company may estimate its total consolidated assets, subject to review and adjustment by the Board; or(3) Depository institution holding company in a supervised insurance organization; or(4) An institution that is otherwise made subject to this subpart by the Board.(c) Exclusion of certain depository institution holding companies. Notwithstanding paragraph (b) of this section, this subpart does not apply to a top-tier depository institution holding company that\u2014(1) Exclusively files financial statements in accordance with Statutory Accounting Principles (SAP);(2) Is not subject to a state insurance capital requirement; and(3) Has no subsidiary depository institution holding company that\u2014(i) Is subject to a capital requirement; or(ii) Does not exclusively file financial statements in accordance with SAP.(d) Reservation of authority\u2014(1) Regulatory capital resources.

If the Board determines that the building block capital requirement for any depository institution holding company is not commensurate with the risks of the depository institution holding company, the Board may adjust the building block capital requirement and building block available capital for the supervised insurance organization.(3) Structural requirements. In order to achieve the appropriate application of this subpart, the Board may require a supervised insurance organization to take any of the following actions with respect to the application of this subpart, if the Board determines that such action would better reflect the risk profile of an inventory company or the supervised insurance organization:(i) Identify components under this subpart differently than as done by the supervised insurance organization. This could include a different identification of a top-tier depository institution holding company, an inventory company, a material financial entity, or a building block parent, then that made by the supervised insurance organization; or(ii) Set a building block parent's allocation share of a downstream building block parent equal to 100 percent.(4) Other reservation of authority.

The subpoena must name the witness whose deposition is to be taken and specify the time, manner, and place for taking the deposition. A deposition subpoena may require the witness to be deposed at any place within the country in which that witness resides or has a regular place of employment, by remote means, or such other convenient place or manner, as the ALJ fixes.(3) Any requested subpoena that sets forth a valid basis for its issuance must be promptly issued, unless the ALJ requires a written response or requires attendance at a conference concerning whether the requested subpoena should be issued.(4) The party obtaining a deposition subpoena is responsible for serving it on the witness and for serving copies on all parties. Unless the ALJ orders otherwise, no deposition under this section may be taken on fewer than ten days' notice to the witness and all parties.(b) Objections to deposition subpoenas. (1) The witness and any party who has not had an opportunity to oppose a deposition subpoena issued under this section may file a motion with the ALJ to quash or modify the subpoena prior to the time for compliance specified in the subpoena, but not more than ten days after service of the subpoena.(2) A statement of the basis for the motion to quash or modify a subpoena issued under this section must accompany the motion. The motion must be served on all parties.(c) Procedure upon deposition. (1) Each witness testifying pursuant to a deposition subpoena must be duly sworn. By stipulation of the parties or by order of the ALJ, a court reporter or other person authorized to administer an oath may administer the oath remotely without being in the physical presence of the deponent. Each party must have the right to examine the witness. Objections to questions or documents must be in short form, stating the grounds for the objection. Failure to object to questions or documents is not deemed a waiver except where the ground for the objection might have been avoided if the objection had been timely presented. All questions, answers, and objections must be recorded.(2) Any party may move before the ALJ for an order compelling the witness to answer any questions the witness has refused to answer or submit any evidence the witness has refused to submit during the deposition.(3) The deposition must be subscribed by the witness, unless the parties and the witness, by stipulation, have waived the signing, or the witness is ill, cannot be found, or has refused to sign. If the deposition is not subscribed by the witness, the court reporter taking the deposition must certify that the transcript is a true and complete transcript of the deposition.(d) Enforcing subpoenas.

However, if the deposit account is restructured during this grace period, the insurance coverage may be affected. If the account is not restructured within six months after the owner's death, the insurance shall be provided on the basis of actual ownership in accordance with the provisions of \u00a7 330.5(a)(1).", "context": "\u00a7 330.3 General principles.(a) Ownership rights and capacities. The insurance coverage provided by the Act and this part is based upon the ownership rights and capacities in which deposit accounts are maintained at insured depository institutions. All deposits in an insured depository institution which are maintained in the same right and capacity (by or for the benefit of a particular depositor or depositors) shall be added together and insured in accordance with this part. Deposits maintained in different rights and capacities, as recognized under this part, shall be insured separately from each other. (Example: Single ownership accounts and joint ownership accounts are insured separately from each other.)(b) Deposits maintained in separate insured depository institutions or in separate branches of the same insured depository institution. Any deposit accounts maintained by a depositor at one insured depository institution are insured separately from, and without regard to, any deposit accounts that the same depositor maintains at any other separately chartered and insured depository institution, even if two or more separately chartered and insured depository institutions are affiliated through common ownership. (Example: Deposits held by the same individual at two different banks owned by the same bank holding company would be insured separately, per bank.)The deposit accounts of a depositor maintained in the same right and capacity at different branches or offices of the same insured depository institution are not separately insured; rather they shall be added together and insured in accordance with this part.(c) Deposits maintained by foreigners and deposits denominated in foreign currency. The availability of deposit insurance is not limited to citizens and residents of the United States. Any person or entity that maintains deposits in an insured depository institution is entitled to the deposit insurance provided by the Act and this part. In addition, deposits denominated in a foreign currency shall be insured in accordance with this part. Deposit insurance for such deposits shall be determined and paid in the amount of United States dollars that is equivalent in value to the amount of the deposit denominated in the foreign currency as of close of business on the date of default of the insured depository institution. The exchange rates to be used for such conversions are the 12 PM rates (the \u201cnoon buying rates for cable transfers\u201d) quoted for major currencies by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on the date of default of the insured depository institution, unless the deposit agreement specifies that some other widely recognized exchange rates are to be used for all purposes under that agreement, in which case, the rates so specified shall be used for such conversions.(d) Deposits in insured branches of foreign banks. Deposits in an insured branch of a foreign bank which are payable by contract in the United States shall be insured in accordance with this part, except that any deposits to the credit of the foreign bank, or any office, branch, agency or any wholly owned subsidiary of the foreign bank, shall not be insured. All deposits held by a depositor in the same right and capacity in more than one insured branch of the same foreign bank shall be added together for the purpose of determining the amount of deposit insurance.(e) Deposits payable outside of the United States and certain other locations. (1) Any obligation of an insured depository institution which is payable solely at an office of that institution located outside any State, as the term \u201cState\u201d is defined in section 3(a)(3) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 1813(a)(3)), is not a deposit for the purposes of this part.(2) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, any obligation of an insured depository institution which is carried on the books and records of an office of that institution located outside any State, as referred to in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, shall not be an insured deposit for purposes of this part, or any other provision of this part, notwithstanding that the obligation may also be payable at an office of that institution located within any State.(3) Rule of construction. For purposes of this paragraph (e), Overseas Military Banking Facilities operated under Department of Defense regulations, 32 CFR Parts 230 and 231, are not considered to be offices located outside any State, as referred to in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.(f) International banking facility deposits. An \u201cinternational banking facility time deposit,\u201d as defined by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in Regulation D (12 CFR 204.8(a)(2)), or in any successor regulation, is not a deposit for the purposes of this part.(g) Bank investment contracts. As required by section 11(a)(8) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 1821(a)(8)), any liability arising under any investment contract between any insured depository institution and any employee benefit plan which expressly permits \u201cbenefit responsive withdrawals or transfers\u201d (as defined in section 11(a)(8) of the Act) are not insured deposits for purposes of this part. The term \u201csubstantial penalty or adjustment\u201d used in section 11(a)(8) of the Act means, in the case of a deposit having an original term which exceeds one year, all interest earned on the amount withdrawn from the date of deposit or for six months, whichever is less; or, in the case of a deposit having an original term of one year or less, all interest earned on the amount withdrawn from the date of deposit or three months, whichever is less.(h) Application of state or local law to deposit insurance determinations. In general, deposit insurance is for the benefit of the owner or owners of funds on deposit. However, while ownership under state law of deposited funds is a necessary condition for deposit insurance, ownership under state law is not sufficient for, or decisive in, determining deposit insurance coverage. Deposit insurance coverage is also a function of the deposit account records of the insured depository institution and of the provisions of this part, which, in the interest of uniform national rules for deposit insurance coverage, are controlling for purposes of determining deposit insurance coverage.(i) Determination of the amount of a deposit\u2014(1) General rule. The amount of a deposit is the balance of principal and interest unconditionally credited to the deposit account as of the date of default of the insured depository institution, plus the ascertainable amount of interest to that date, accrued at the contract rate (or the anticipated or announced interest or dividend rate), which the insured depository institution in default would have paid if the deposit had matured on that date and the insured depository institution had not failed. In the absence of any such announced or anticipated interest or dividend rate, the rate for this purpose shall be whatever rate was paid in the immediately preceding payment period.(2) Discounted certificates of deposit. The amount of a certificate of deposit sold by an insured depository institution at a discount from its face value is its original purchase price plus the amount of accrued earnings calculated by compounding interest annually at the rate necessary to increase the original purchase price to the maturity value over the life of the certificate.(3) Waiver of minimum requirements. In the case of a deposit with a fixed payment date, fixed or minimum term, or a qualifying or notice period that has not expired as of such date, interest thereon to the date of closing shall be computed according to the terms of the deposit contract as if interest had been credited and as if the deposit could have been withdrawn on such date without any penalty or reduction in the rate of earnings.(j) Continuation of insurance coverage following the death of a deposit owner. The death of a deposit owner shall not affect the insurance coverage of the deposit for a period of six months following the owner's death unless the deposit account is restructured. The operation of this grace period, however, shall not result in a reduction of coverage. If an account is not restructured within six months after the owner's death, the insurance shall be provided on the basis of actual ownership in accordance with the provisions of \u00a7 330.5(a)(1).[63 FR 25756, May 11, 1998, as amended at 64 FR 15656, Apr. 1, 1999; 78 FR 56589, Sept. 13, 2013] ", "section_metadata": {"chapter_title": "CHAPTER III\u2014FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION", "chapter_id": "III", "volume_title": "PART 330\u2014DEPOSIT INSURANCE COVERAGE", "volume_id": "330", "section_id": "330.3", "section_title": "\u00a7 330.3 General principles.", "unique_id": "III.330.3"}}

The Board replied that, until such stock qualifies as margin stock, this would not be applicable to such a loan.(b) The Board has now been asked what the position of the lending bank would be under this part if, after the date on which the stock should become registered, such bank continued to hold a loan of the kind just described. It is assumed that the loan was in an amount greater than the maximum loan value for the collateral specified in this part.(c) If the stock should become registered, the loan would then be for the purpose of purchasing or carrying a margin stock, and, if secured directly or indirectly by any margin stock, would be subject to this part as from the date the stock was registered. Under this part, this does not mean that the bank would have to obtain reduction of the loan in order to reduce it to an amount no more than the specified maximum loan value. It does mean, however, that so long as the loan balance exceeded the specified maximum loan value, the bank could not permit any withdrawals or substitutions of collateral that would increase such excess; nor could the bank increase the amount of the loan balance unless there was provided additional collateral having a maximum loan value at least equal to the amount of the increase. In other words, as from the date the stock should become a margin stock, the loan would be subject to this part in exactly the same way, for example, as a loan subject to this part that became under-margined because of a decline in the current market value of the loan collateral or because of a decrease by the Board in the maximum loan value of the loan collateral.", "section_metadata": {"chapter_title": "CHAPTER II\u2014FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM", "chapter_id": "II", "volume_title": "PART 221\u2014CREDIT BY BANKS AND PERSONS OTHER THAN BROKERS OR DEALERS FOR THE PURPOSE OF PURCHASING OR CARRYING MARGIN STOCK (REGULATION U)", "volume_id": "221", "section_id": "221.108", "section_title": "\u00a7 221.108 Effect of registration of stock subsequent to making of loan.", "unique_id": "II.221.108"}}

This means that the transferee customer is not required to deposit additional margin for transactions that occurred before the transfer. However, any margin deficiency existing on the day of the transfer must still be satisfied by the transferee customer.

(1) All transactions not specifically authorized for inclusion in another account shall be recorded in the margin account.(2) A creditor may establish separate margin accounts for the same person to:(i) Clear transactions for other creditors where the transactions are introduced to the clearing creditor by separate creditors; or(ii) Clear transactions through other creditors if the transactions are cleared by separate creditors; or(iii) Provide one or more accounts over which the creditor or a third party investment adviser has investment discretion.(b) Required margin\u2014(1) Applicability. The required margin for each long or short position in securities is set forth in \u00a7 220.12 (the Supplement) and is subject to the following exceptions and special provisions.(2) Short sale against the box. A short sale \u201cagainst the box\u201d shall be treated as a long sale for the purpose of computing the equity and the required margin.(3) When-issued securities. The required margin on a net long or net short commitment in a when-issued security is the margin that would be required if the security were an issued margin security, plus any unrealized loss on the commitment or less any unrealized gain.(4) Stock used as cover. (i) When a short position held in the account serves in lieu of the required margin for a short put, the amount prescribed by paragraph (b)(1) of this section as the amount to be added to the required margin in respect of short sales shall be increased by any unrealized loss on the position.(ii) When a security held in the account serves in lieu of the required margin for a short call, the security shall be valued at no greater than the exercise price of the short call.(5) Accounts of partners. If a partner of the creditor has a margin account with the creditor, the creditor shall disregard the partner's financial relations with the firm (as shown in the partner's capital and ordinary drawing accounts) in calculating the margin or equity of the partner's margin account.(6) Contribution to joint venture. If a margin account is the account of a joint venture in which the creditor participates, any interest of the creditor in the joint account in excess of the interest which the creditor would have on the basis of its right to share in the profits shall be treated as an extension of credit to the joint account and shall be margined as such.(7) Transfer of accounts. (i) A margin account that is transferred from one creditor to another may be treated as if it had been maintained by the transferee from the date of its origin, if the transferee accepts, in good faith, a signed statement of the transferor (or, if that is not practicable, of the customer), that any margin call issued under this part has been satisfied.(ii) A margin account that is transferred from one customer to another as part of a transaction, not undertaken to avoid the requirements of this part, may be treated as if it had been maintained for the transferee from the date of its origin, if the creditor accepts in good faith and keeps with the transferee account a signed statement of the transferor describing the circumstances for the transfer.(8) Sound credit judgment. In exercising sound credit judgment to determine the margin required in good faith pursuant to \u00a7 220.12 (the Supplement), the creditor shall make its determination for a specified security position without regard to the customer's other assets or securities positions held in connection with unrelated transactions.(c) When additional margin is required\u2014(1) Computing deficiency. All transactions on the same day shall be combined to determine whether additional margin is required by the creditor. For the purpose of computing equity in an account, security positions are established or eliminated and a credit or debit created on the trade date of a security transaction. Additional margin is required on any day when the day's transactions create or increase a margin deficiency in the account and shall be for the amount of the margin deficiency so created or increased.(2) Satisfaction of deficiency. The additional required margin may be satisfied by a transfer from the special memorandum account or by a deposit of cash, margin securities, exempted securities, or any combination thereof.(3) Time limits. (i) A margin call shall be satisfied within one payment period after the margin deficiency was created or increased.(ii) The payment period may be extended for one or more limited periods upon application by the creditor to its examining authority unless the examining authority believes that the creditor is not acting in good faith or that the creditor has not sufficiently determined that exceptional circumstances warrant such action. Applications shall be filed and acted upon prior to the end of the payment period or the expiration of any subsequent extension.(4) Satisfaction restriction. Any transaction, position, or deposit that is used to satisfy one requirement under this part shall be unavailable to satisfy any other requirement.(d) Liquidation in lieu of deposit. If any margin call is not met in full within the required time, the creditor shall liquidate securities sufficient to meet the margin call or to eliminate any margin deficiency existing on the day such liquidation is required, whichever is less. If the margin deficiency created or increased is $1000 or less, no action need be taken by the creditor.(e) Withdrawals of cash or securities. (1) Cash or securities may be withdrawn from an account, except if:(i) Additional cash or securities are required to be deposited into the account for a transaction on the same or a previous day; or(ii) The withdrawal, together with other transactions, deposits, and withdrawals on the same day, would create or increase a margin deficiency.(2) Margin excess may be withdrawn or may be transferred to the special memorandum account (\u00a7 220.5) by making a single entry to that account which will represent a debit to the margin account and a credit to the special memorandum account.(3) If a creditor does not receive a distribution of cash or securities which is payable with respect to any security in a margin account on the day it is payable and withdrawal would not be permitted under this paragraph (e), a withdrawal transaction shall be deemed to have occurred on the day the distribution is payable.(f) Interest, service charges, etc. (1) Without regard to the other provisions of this section, the creditor, in its usual practice, may debit the following items to a margin account if they are considered in calculating the balance of such account:(i) Interest charged on credit maintained in the margin account;(ii) Premiums on securities borrowed in connection with short sales or to effect delivery;(iii) Dividends, interest, or other distributions due on borrowed securities;(iv) Communication or shipping charges with respect to transactions in the margin account; and(v) Any other service charges which the creditor may impose.(2) A creditor may permit interest, dividends, or other distributions credited to a margin account to be withdrawn from the account if:(i) The withdrawal does not create or increase a margin deficiency in the account; or(ii) The current market value of any securities withdrawn does not exceed 10 percent of the current market value of the security with respect to which they were distributed.[Reg.

For purposes of section 4(g) of the IBA, 12 U.S.C. 3102(g), unless otherwise provided by the OCC, a foreign bank's capital equivalency deposits (CED) must consist of:(i) Investment securities eligible for investment by national banks;(ii) United States dollar deposits payable in the United States or payable in any other Group of Ten country;(iii) Certificates of deposit, payable in the United States, and banker's acceptances, provided that, in either case, the issuer has an adequate capacity to meet financial commitments for the projected life of the asset or exposure. An issuer has an adequate capacity to meet financial commitments if the risk of default by the obligor is low and the full and timely repayment of principal and interest is expected;(iv) Repurchase agreements; or(v) Other similar assets permitted by the OCC to qualify to be included in the CED.(2) Legal requirements. The agreement with the depository bank to hold the CED and the amount of the deposit must comply with the requirements in section 4(g) of the IBA, 12 U.S.C. 3102(g). If a foreign bank has more than one Federal branch or agency in a state, it shall determine the CED and the amount of liabilities requiring capital equivalency coverage on an aggregate basis for all the foreign bank's Federal branches or agencies in that state.(3) Exceptions. In determining the amount of the CED, the OCC excludes liabilities of an international banking facility (IBF) to third parties and of a Federal branch of a foreign bank to an IBF. The OCC may exclude liabilities from repurchase agreements on a case-by-case basis.(b) Increase in capital equivalency deposits. For prudential or supervisory reasons, the OCC may require, in individual cases or otherwise, that a foreign bank increase its CED above the minimum amount. For example, the OCC may require an increase if a Federal branch or agency of the foreign bank increases its leverage through the establishment, acquisition, or maintenance of an operating subsidiary.(c) Value of assets. The obligations referred to in paragraph (a) of this section must be valued at principal amount or market value, whichever is lower.(d) Deposit arrangements. A foreign bank should require its depository bank to segregate its CED on the depository bank's books and records. The funds deposited and obligations referred to in paragraph (a) of this section that are placed in safekeeping at a depository bank to satisfy a foreign bank's CED requirement:(1) May not be reduced in value below the minimum required for that branch or agency without the prior approval of the OCC, but in no event below the statutory minimum;(2) Must be maintained pursuant to an agreement prescribed by the OCC that shall be a written agreement entered into with the OCC for purposes of section 8 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, 12 U.S.C. 1818; and(3) Must be free from any lien, charge, right of setoff, credit, or preference in connection with any claim of the depository bank against the foreign bank.(e)(1) Deposit and Consolidation. As provided in 12 U.S.C. 3102(g), a foreign bank with a Federal branch or agency shall deposit its CED into an account in a bank that is located in the state in which the Federal branch or agency is located. For this purpose, such depository bank is considered to be located in those states in which it has its main office or a branch.

It should be understood, of course, that such account provides a relatively short credit period of up to 7 business days even with so-called cash transactions. This amendment was in accordance with the Board's understanding in 1969, when the insurance premium funding provisions were adopted in \u00a7 220.4(k), that firms engaged in a general securities business would not also be engaged in the sale and arranging of credit in connection with such insurance premium funding programs.(b) The 1972 amendment eliminated from \u00a7 220.4(k) the requirement that, to be eligible for the provisions of the section, a creditor had to be the issuer, or a subsidiary or affiliate of the issuer, of programs which combine the acquisition of both mutual fund shares and insurance. Thus the amendment permits an independent broker/dealer to sell such a program and to arrange for financing in that connection. In reaching such decision, the Board again relied upon the earlier understanding that independent broker/dealers who would sell such programs would not be engaged in transacting a general securities business.(c) In response to a specific view recently expressed, the Board agrees that under Regulation T:* * * a broker/dealer dealing in special insurance premium funding products can only extend credit in connection with such products or in connection with the sale of shares of registered investment companies under the cash accounts * * * (and) cannot engage in the general securities business or sell any securities other than shares * * * (in) registered investment companies through a cash account or any other manner involving the extension of credit.(d) There is a way, of course, as has been indicated, that an independent broker/dealer might be able to sell other than shares of registered investment companies without creating any conflict with the regulation. Such sales could be executed on a \u201cfunds on hand\u201d basis and in the case of payment by check, would have to include the collection of such check. It is understood from industry sources, however, that few if any independent broker/dealers engage solely in a \u201cfund on hand\u201d type of operation.[38 FR 11066, May 4, 1973] ", "section_metadata": {"chapter_title": "CHAPTER II\u2014FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM", "chapter_id": "II", "volume_title": "PART 220\u2014CREDIT BY BROKERS AND DEALERS (REGULATION T)", "volume_id": "220", "section_id": "220.127", "section_title": "\u00a7 220.127 Independent broker/dealers arranging credit in connection with the sale of insurance premium funding programs.", "unique_id": "II.220.127"}}

(Source: paragraphs a, b, d)", "context": "\u00a7 225.118 Computer services for customers of subsidiary banks.(a) The question has been presented to the Board of Governors whether a wholly-owned nonbanking subsidiary (\u201cservice company\u201d) of a bank holding company, which is now exempt from the prohibitions of section 4 of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (\u201cthe Act\u201d) because its sole business is the providing of services for the holding company and the latter's subsidiary banks, would lose its exempt status if it should provide data processing services for customers of the subsidiary banks.(b) The Board understood from the facts presented that the service company owns a computer which it utilizes to furnish data processing services for the subsidiary banks of its parent holding company. Customers of these banks have requested that the banks provide for them computerized billing, accounting, and financial records maintenance services. The banks wish to utilize the computer services of the service company in providing these and other services of a similar nature. It is proposed that, in each instance where a subsidiary bank undertakes to provide such services, the bank will enter into a contract directly with the customer and then arrange to have the service company perform the services for it, the bank. In no case will the service company provide services for anyone other than its affiliated banks. Moreover, it will not hold itself out as, nor will its parent corporation or affiliated banks represent it to be, authorized or willing to provide services for others.(c) Section 4(c)(1) of the Act permits a holding company to own shares in \u201cany company engaged solely * * * in the business of furnishing services to or performing services for such holding company and banks with respect to which it is a bank holding company * * *.\u201d The Board has ruled heretofore that the term \u201cservices\u201d as used in section 4(c)(1) is to be read as relating to those services (excluding \u201cclosely related\u201d activities of \u201ca financial, fiduciary, or insurance nature\u201d within the meaning of section 4(c)(6)) which a bank itself can provide for its customers (\u00a7 225.104). A determination as to whether a particular service may legitimately be rendered or performed by a bank for its customers must be made in the light of applicable Federal or State statutory or regulatory provisions. In the case of a State-chartered bank, the laws of the State in which the bank operates, together with any interpretations thereunder rendered by appropriate bank authorities, would govern the right of the bank to provide a particular service. In the case of a national bank, a similar determination would require reference to provisions of Federal law relating to the establishment and operation of national banks, as well as to pertinent rulings or interpretations promulgated thereunder.(d) Accordingly, on the assumption that all of the services to be performed are of the kinds that the holding company's subsidiary banks may render for their customers under applicable Federal or State law, the Board concluded that the rendition of such services by the service company for its affiliated banks would not adversely affect its exempt status under section 4(c)(1) of the Act.(e) In arriving at the above conclusion, the Board emphasized that its views were premised explicitly upon the facts presented to it, and particularly its understanding that banks are permitted, under applicable Federal or State law to provide the proposed computer services. The Board emphasized also that in respect to the service company's operations, there continues in effect the requirement under section 4(c)(1) that the service company engage solely in the business of furnishing services to or performing services for the bank holding company and its subsidiary banks. The Board added that any substantial change in the facts that had been presented might require re-examination of the service company's status under section 4(c)(1).[29 FR 12361, Aug. 28, 1964.

The risk-weighted asset amount for a securitization exposure equals its SFA risk-based capital requirement as calculated under paragraph (c) and (d) of this section, multiplied by 12.5.(c) The SFA risk-based capital requirement. (1) If KIRB is greater than or equal to L + T, an exposure's SFA risk-based capital requirement equals the exposure amount.(2) If KIRB is less than or equal to L, an exposure's SFA risk-based capital requirement is UE multiplied by TP multiplied by the greater of:(i) F \u00b7 T (where F is 0.016 for all securitization exposures); or(ii) S[L + T] \u2212 S[L].(3) If KIRB is greater than L and less than L + T, the FDIC-supervised institution must apply a 1,250 percent risk weight to an amount equal to UE \u00b7 TP \u00b7 (KIRB \u2212 L), and the exposure's SFA risk-based capital requirement is UE multiplied by TP multiplied by the greater of:(i) F \u00b7 (T \u2212 (KIRB \u2212 L)) (where F is 0.016 for all other securitization exposures); or(ii) S[L + T] \u2212 S[KIRB].(d) The supervisory formula:(e) SFA parameters. For purposes of the calculations in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section:(1) Amount of the underlying exposures (UE). UE is the EAD of any underlying exposures that are wholesale and retail exposures (including the amount of any funded spread accounts, cash collateral accounts, and other similar funded credit enhancements) plus the amount of any underlying exposures that are securitization exposures (as defined in \u00a7 324.142(e)) plus the adjusted carrying value of any underlying exposures that are equity exposures (as defined in \u00a7 324.151(b)).(2) Tranche percentage (TP). TP is the ratio of the amount of the FDIC-supervised institution's securitization exposure to the amount of the tranche that contains the securitization exposure.(3) Capital requirement on underlying exposures (KIRB). (i) KIRB is the ratio of:(A) The sum of the risk-based capital requirements for the underlying exposures plus the expected credit losses of the underlying exposures (as determined under this subpart E as if the underlying exposures were directly held by the FDIC-supervised institution); to(B) UE.(ii) The calculation of KIRB must reflect the effects of any credit risk mitigant applied to the underlying exposures (either to an individual underlying exposure, to a group of underlying exposures, or to all of the underlying exposures).(iii) All assets related to the securitization are treated as underlying exposures, including assets in a reserve account (such as a cash collateral account).(4) Credit enhancement level (L). (i) L is the ratio of:(A) The amount of all securitization exposures subordinated to the tranche that contains the FDIC-supervised institution's securitization exposure; to(B) UE.(ii) An FDIC-supervised institution must determine L before considering the effects of any tranche-specific credit enhancements.(iii) Any gain-on-sale or CEIO associated with the securitization may not be included in L.(iv) Any reserve account funded by accumulated cash flows from the underlying exposures that is subordinated to the tranche that contains the FDIC-supervised institution's securitization exposure may be included in the numerator and denominator of L to the extent cash has accumulated in the account. Unfunded reserve accounts (that is, reserve accounts that are to be funded from future cash flows from the underlying exposures) may not be included in the calculation of L.(v) In some cases, the purchase price of receivables will reflect a discount that provides credit enhancement (for example, first loss protection) for all or certain tranches of the securitization. When this arises, L should be calculated inclusive of this discount if the discount provides credit enhancement for the securitization exposure.(5) Thickness of tranche (T). T is the ratio of:(i) The amount of the tranche that contains the FDIC-supervised institution's securitization exposure; to(ii) UE.(6) Effective number of exposures (N). (i) Unless the FDIC-supervised institution elects to use the formula provided in paragraph (f) of this section,where EADi represents the EAD associated with the i th instrument in the underlying exposures.(ii) Multiple exposures to one obligor must be treated as a single underlying exposure.(iii) In the case of a resecuritization, the FDIC-supervised institution must treat each underlying exposure as a single underlying exposure and must not look through to the originally securitized underlying exposures.(7) Exposure-weighted average loss given default (EWALGD). EWALGD is calculated as:where LGDi represents the average LGD associated with all exposures to the i th obligor. In the case of a resecuritization, an LGD of 100 percent must be assumed for the underlying exposures that are themselves securitization exposures.(f) Simplified method for computing N and EWALGD. (1) If all underlying exposures of a securitization are retail exposures, an FDIC-supervised institution may apply the SFA using the following simplifications:(i) h = 0; and(ii) v = 0.(2) Under the conditions in \u00a7\u00a7 324.143(f)(3) and (f)(4), an FDIC-supervised institution may employ a simplified method for calculating N and EWALGD.(3) If C1 is no more than 0.03, an FDIC-supervised institution may set EWALGD = 0.50 if none of the underlying exposures is a securitization exposure, or may set EWALGD = 1 if one or more of the underlying exposures is a securitization exposure, and may set N equal to the following amount:where: (i) Cm is the ratio of the sum of the amounts of the `m' largest underlying exposures to UE; and (ii) The level of m is to be selected by the FDIC-supervised institution.(4) Alternatively, if only C1 is available and C1 is no more than 0.03, the FDIC-supervised institution may set EWALGD = 0.50 if none of the underlying exposures is a securitization exposure, or may set EWALGD = 1 if one or more of the underlying exposures is a securitization exposure and may set N = 1/C1.", "section_metadata": {"chapter_title": "CHAPTER III\u2014FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION", "chapter_id": "III", "volume_title": "PART 324\u2014CAPITAL ADEQUACY OF FDIC-SUPERVISED INSTITUTIONS", "volume_id": "324", "section_id": "324.143", "section_title": "\u00a7 324.143 Supervisory formula approach (SFA).", "unique_id": "III.324.143"}}

An applicant may be requested to designate a title on an application form (such as Ms., Miss, Mr., or Mrs.) if the form discloses that the designation of a title is optional. An application form shall otherwise use only terms that are neutral as to sex.(c) Information about a spouse or former spouse\u2014(1) General rule. Except as permitted in this paragraph, a creditor may not request any information concerning the spouse or former spouse of an applicant.(2) Permissible inquiries. A creditor may request any information concerning an applicant's spouse (or former spouse under paragraph (c)(2)(v) of this section) that may be requested about the applicant if:(i) The spouse will be permitted to use the account;(ii) The spouse will be contractually liable on the account;(iii) The applicant is relying on the spouse's income as a basis for repayment of the credit requested;(iv) The applicant resides in a community property state or is relying on property located in such a state as a basis for repayment of the credit requested; or(v) The applicant is relying on alimony, child support, or separate maintenance payments from a spouse or former spouse as a basis for repayment of the credit requested.(3) Other accounts of the applicant. A creditor may request that an applicant list any account on which the applicant is contractually liable and to provide the name and address of the person in whose name the account is held. A creditor may also ask an applicant to list the names in which the applicant has previously received credit.(d) Other limitations on information requests\u2014(1) Marital status. If an applicant applies for individual unsecured credit, a creditor shall not inquire about the applicant's marital status unless the applicant resides in a community property state or is relying on property located in such a state as a basis for repayment of the credit requested. If an application is for other than individual unsecured credit, a creditor may inquire about the applicant's marital status, but shall use only the terms married, unmarried, and separated. A creditor may explain that the category unmarried includes single, divorced, and widowed persons.(2) Disclosure about income from alimony, child support, or separate maintenance. A creditor shall not inquire whether income stated in an application is derived from alimony, child support, or separate maintenance payments unless the creditor discloses to the applicant that such income need not be revealed if the applicant does not want the creditor to consider it in determining the applicant's creditworthiness.(3) Childbearing, childrearing. A creditor shall not inquire about birth control practices, intentions concerning the bearing or rearing of children, or capability to bear children. A creditor may inquire about the number and ages of an applicant's dependents or about dependent-related financial obligations or expenditures, provided such information is requested without regard to sex, marital status, or any other prohibited basis.(e) Permanent residency and immigration status.

UE is the EAD of any underlying exposures that are wholesale and retail exposures (including the amount of any funded spread accounts, cash collateral accounts, and other similar funded credit enhancements) plus the amount of any underlying exposures that are securitization exposures (as defined in \u00a7 217.142(e)) plus the adjusted carrying value of any underlying exposures that are equity exposures (as defined in \u00a7 217.151(b)).(2) Tranche percentage (TP). TP is the ratio of the amount of the Board-regulated institution's securitization exposure to the amount of the tranche that contains the securitization exposure.(3) Capital requirement on underlying exposures (KIRB). (i) KIRB is the ratio of:(A) The sum of the risk-based capital requirements for the underlying exposures plus the expected credit losses of the underlying exposures (as determined under this subpart E as if the underlying exposures were directly held by the Board-regulated institution); to(B) UE.(ii) The calculation of KIRB must reflect the effects of any credit risk mitigant applied to the underlying exposures (either to an individual underlying exposure, to a group of underlying exposures, or to all of the underlying exposures).(iii) All assets related to the securitization are treated as underlying exposures, including assets in a reserve account (such as a cash collateral account).(4) Credit enhancement level (L). (i) L is the ratio of:(A) The amount of all securitization exposures subordinated to the tranche that contains the Board-regulated institution's securitization exposure; to(B) UE.(ii) A Board-regulated institution must determine L before considering the effects of any tranche-specific credit enhancements.(iii) Any gain-on-sale or CEIO associated with the securitization may not be included in L.(iv) Any reserve account funded by accumulated cash flows from the underlying exposures that is subordinated to the tranche that contains the Board-regulated institution's securitization exposure may be included in the numerator and denominator of L to the extent cash has accumulated in the account. Unfunded reserve accounts (that is, reserve accounts that are to be funded from future cash flows from the underlying exposures) may not be included in the calculation of L.(v) In some cases, the purchase price of receivables will reflect a discount that provides credit enhancement (for example, first loss protection) for all or certain tranches of the securitization. When this arises, L should be calculated inclusive of this discount if the discount provides credit enhancement for the securitization exposure.(5) Thickness of tranche (T). T is the ratio of:(i) The amount of the tranche that contains the Board-regulated institution's securitization exposure; to(ii) UE.(6) Effective number of exposures (N). (i) Unless the Board-regulated institution elects to use the formula provided in paragraph (f) of this section,where EADi represents the EAD associated with the ith instrument in the underlying exposures.(ii) Multiple exposures to one obligor /must be treated as a single underlying exposure.(iii) In the case of a resecuritization, the Board-regulated institution must treat each underlying exposure as a single underlying exposure and must not look through to the originally securitized underlying exposures.(7) Exposure-weighted average loss given default (EWALGD).

The risk-weighted asset amount of the effective portion of the hedge pair is equal to its adjusted carrying value.(b) Full look-through approach. An FDIC-supervised institution that is able to calculate a risk-weighted asset amount for its proportional ownership share of each exposure held by the investment fund (as calculated under this subpart E of this part as if the proportional ownership share of each exposure were held directly by the FDIC-supervised institution) may either:(1) Set the risk-weighted asset amount of the FDIC-supervised institution's exposure to the fund equal to the product of:(i) The aggregate risk-weighted asset amounts of the exposures held by the fund as if they were held directly by the FDIC-supervised institution; and(ii) The FDIC-supervised institution's proportional ownership share of the fund; or(2) Include the FDIC-supervised institution's proportional ownership share of each exposure held by the fund in the FDIC-supervised institution's IMA.(c) Simple modified look-through approach. Under this approach, the risk-weighted asset amount for an FDIC-supervised institution's equity exposure to an investment fund equals the adjusted carrying value of the equity exposure multiplied by the highest risk weight assigned according to subpart D of this part that applies to any exposure the fund is permitted to hold under its prospectus, partnership agreement, or similar contract that defines the fund's permissible investments (excluding derivative contracts that are used for hedging rather than speculative purposes and that do not constitute a material portion of the fund's exposures).(d) Alternative modified look-through approach.

The risk-weighted asset amount for the FDIC-supervised institution's equity exposure to the investment fund equals the sum of each portion of the adjusted carrying value assigned to an exposure class multiplied by the applicable risk weight. If the sum of the investment limits for all exposure types within the fund exceeds 100 percent, the FDIC-supervised institution must assume that the fund invests to the maximum extent permitted under its investment limits in the exposure type with the highest risk weight under subpart D of this part, and continues to make investments in order of the exposure type with the next highest risk weight under subpart D of this part until the maximum total investment level is reached.

Credit A would be extended for the purpose of providing the customer with working capital (nonpurpose credit), collateralized by margin stock. Credit B would be extended for the purpose of purchasing or carrying margin stock (purpose credit), without collateral or on collateral other than stock.(b) This part allows a bank to extend purpose and nonpurpose credits simultaneously or successively to the same customer. This rule is expressed in \u00a7 221.3(d)(4) which provides in substance that for any nonpurpose credit to the same customer, the lender shall in good faith require as much collateral not already identified to the customer's purpose credit as the lender would require if it held neither the purpose loan nor the identified collateral. This rule in \u00a7 221.3(d)(4) also takes into account that the lender would not necessarily be required to hold collateral for the nonpurpose credit if, consistent with good faith banking practices, it would normally make this kind of nonpurpose loan without collateral.(c) The Board views \u00a7 221.3(d)(4), when read in conjunction with \u00a7 221.3(c) and (f), as requiring that whenever a lender extends two credits to the same customer, one a purpose credit and the other nonpurpose, any margin stock collateral must first be identified with and attributed to the purpose loan by taking into account the maximum loan value of such collateral as prescribed in \u00a7 221.7 (the Supplement).(d) The Board is further of the opinion that under the foregoing circumstances Credit B would be indirectly secured by stock, despite the fact that there would be separate loan agreements for both credits.

The back pay liability under title VII or the Rehabilitation Act is limited to two years prior to the date the discrimination complaint was filed.(2) If clear and convincing evidence indicates that, although discrimination existed at the time the personnel action was taken, the personnel action would have been taken even absent discrimination, the Board shall nevertheless eliminate any discriminatory practice and ensure it does not recur.(3) Cancellation of an unwarranted personnel action and restoration of the employee.(4) Expunction from the Board's records of any adverse materials relating to the discriminatory employment practice.(5) Full opportunity to participate in the employee benefit denied (e.g., training, preferential work assignments, overtime scheduling).(d) The Board has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the complainant has failed to mitigate his or her damages.(e) Attorney's fees or costs\u2014(1) Awards of attorney's fees or costs. The provisions of this paragraph relating to the award of attorney's fees or costs shall apply to allegations of discrimination prohibited by title VII and the Rehabilitation Act. In a decision or final action, the Board, administrative judge, or Commission may award the applicant or employee or reasonable attorney's fees (including expert witness fees) and other costs incurred in the processing of the complaint.(i) A finding of discrimination raises a presumption of entitlement to an award of attorney's fees.(ii) Any award of attorney's fees or costs shall be paid by the Board.(iii) Attorney's fees are allowable only for the services of members of the Bar and law clerks, paralegals or law students under the supervision of members of the Bar, except that no award is allowable for the services of any employee of the Federal Government.(iv) Attorney's fees shall be paid for services performed by an attorney after the filing of a written complaint, provided that the attorney provides reasonable notice of representation to the Board, administrative judge or Commission, except that fees are allowable for a reasonable period of time prior to the notification of representation for any services performed in reaching a determination to represent the complainant. The Board is not required to pay attorney's fees for services performed during the pre-complaint process, except that fees are allowable when the Commission affirms on appeal an administrative judge's decision finding discrimination after the Board takes final action by not implementing an administrative judge's decision. Written submissions to the Board that are signed by the representative shall be deemed to constitute notice of representation.(2) Amount of awards. (i) When the Board, administrative judge or the Commission determines an entitlement to attorney's fees or costs, the complainant's attorney shall submit a verified statement of attorney's fees (including expert witness fees) and other costs, as appropriate, to the Board or administrative judge within 30 days of receipt of the decision and shall submit a copy of the statement to the Board. A statement of attorney's fees and costs shall be accompanied by an affidavit executed by the attorney of record itemizing the attorney's charges for legal services. The Board may respond to a statement of attorney's fees and costs within 30 days of its receipt. The verified statement, accompanying affidavit and any Board response shall be made a part of the complaint file.(ii)(A) The Board or administrative judge shall issue a decision determining the amount of attorney's fees or costs due within 60 days of receipt of the statement and affidavit. The decision shall include a notice of right to appeal to the EEOC along with EEOC Form 573, Notice of Appeal/Petition and shall include the specific reasons for determining the amount of the award.(B) The amount of attorney's fees shall be calculated using the following standards: The starting point shall be the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate. There is a strong presumption that this amount represents the reasonable fee. In limited circumstances, this amount may be reduced or increased in consideration of the degree of success, quality of representation, and long delay caused by the Board.(C) The costs that may be awarded are those authorized by 28 U.S.C. 1920 to include: Fees of the reporter for all or any of the stenographic transcript necessarily obtained for use in the case; fees and disbursements for printing and witnesses; and fees for exemplification and copies necessarily obtained for use in the case.(iii) Witness fees shall be awarded in accordance with the provisions of 28 U.S.C. 1821, except that no award shall be made for a Federal employee who is in a duty status when made available as a witness.", "section_metadata": {"chapter_title": "CHAPTER II\u2014FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM", "chapter_id": "II", "volume_title": "PART 268\u2014RULES REGARDING EQUAL OPPORTUNITY", "volume_id": "268", "section_id": "268.501", "section_title": "\u00a7 268.501 Remedies and relief.", "unique_id": "II.268.501"}}

A Board-regulated institution may calculate its risk-weighted asset amount for equity exposures using the IMA by modeling publicly traded and non-publicly traded equity exposures (in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section) or by modeling only publicly traded equity exposures (in accordance with paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section).(b) Qualifying criteria. To qualify to use the IMA to calculate risk-weighted assets for equity exposures, a Board-regulated institution must receive prior written approval from the Board. To receive such approval, the Board-regulated institution must demonstrate to the Board's satisfaction that the Board-regulated institution meets the following criteria:(1) The Board-regulated institution must have one or more models that:(i) Assess the potential decline in value of its modeled equity exposures;(ii) Are commensurate with the size, complexity, and composition of the Board-regulated institution's modeled equity exposures; and(iii) Adequately capture both general market risk and idiosyncratic risk.(2) The Board-regulated institution's model must produce an estimate of potential losses for its modeled equity exposures that is no less than the estimate of potential losses produced by a VaR methodology employing a 99th percentile one-tailed confidence interval of the distribution of quarterly returns for a benchmark portfolio of equity exposures comparable to the Board-regulated institution's modeled equity exposures using a long-term sample period.(3) The number of risk factors and exposures in the sample and the data period used for quantification in the Board-regulated institution's model and benchmarking exercise must be sufficient to provide confidence in the accuracy and robustness of the Board-regulated institution's estimates.(4) The Board-regulated institution's model and benchmarking process must incorporate data that are relevant in representing the risk profile of the Board-regulated institution's modeled equity exposures, and must include data from at least one equity market cycle containing adverse market movements relevant to the risk profile of the Board-regulated institution's modeled equity exposures. In addition, the Board-regulated institution's benchmarking exercise must be based on daily market prices for the benchmark portfolio. If the Board-regulated institution's model uses a scenario methodology, the Board-regulated institution must demonstrate that the model produces a conservative estimate of potential losses on the Board-regulated institution's modeled equity exposures over a relevant long-term market cycle. If the Board-regulated institution employs risk factor models, the Board-regulated institution must demonstrate through empirical analysis the appropriateness of the risk factors used.(5) The Board-regulated institution must be able to demonstrate, using theoretical arguments and empirical evidence, that any proxies used in the modeling process are comparable to the Board-regulated institution's modeled equity exposures and that the Board-regulated institution has made appropriate adjustments for differences. The Board-regulated institution must derive any proxies for its modeled equity exposures and benchmark portfolio using historical market data that are relevant to the Board-regulated institution's modeled equity exposures and benchmark portfolio (or, where not, must use appropriately adjusted data), and such proxies must be robust estimates of the risk of the Board-regulated institution's modeled equity exposures.(c) Risk-weighted assets calculation for a Board-regulated institution using the IMA for publicly traded and non-publicly traded equity exposures. If a Board-regulated institution models publicly traded and non-publicly traded equity exposures, the Board-regulated institution's aggregate risk-weighted asset amount for its equity exposures is equal to the sum of:(1) The risk-weighted asset amount of each equity exposure that qualifies for a 0 percent, 20 percent, or 100 percent risk weight under \u00a7 217.152(b)(1) through (b)(3)(i) (as determined under \u00a7 217.152) and each equity exposure to an investment fund (as determined under \u00a7 217.154); and(2) The greater of:(i) The estimate of potential losses on the Board-regulated institution's equity exposures (other than equity exposures referenced in paragraph (c)(1) of this section) generated by the Board-regulated institution's internal equity exposure model multiplied by 12.5; or(ii) The sum of:(A) 200 percent multiplied by the aggregate adjusted carrying value of the Board-regulated institution's publicly traded equity exposures that do not belong to a hedge pair, do not qualify for a 0 percent, 20 percent, or 100 percent risk weight under \u00a7 217.152(b)(1) through (b)(3)(i), and are not equity exposures to an investment fund;(B) 200 percent multiplied by the aggregate ineffective portion of all hedge pairs; and(C) 300 percent multiplied by the aggregate adjusted carrying value of the Board-regulated institution's equity exposures that are not publicly traded, do not qualify for a 0 percent, 20 percent, or 100 percent risk weight under \u00a7 217.152(b)(1) through (b)(3)(i), and are not equity exposures to an investment fund.(d) Risk-weighted assets calculation for a Board-regulated institution using the IMA only for publicly traded equity exposures. If a Board-regulated institution models only publicly traded equity exposures, the Board-regulated institution's aggregate risk-weighted asset amount for its equity exposures is equal to the sum of:(1) The risk-weighted asset amount of each equity exposure that qualifies for a 0 percent, 20 percent, or 100 percent risk weight under \u00a7\u00a7 217.152(b)(1) through (b)(3)(i) (as determined under \u00a7 217.152), each equity exposure that qualifies for a 400 percent risk weight under \u00a7 217.152(b)(5) or a 600 percent risk weight under \u00a7 217.152(b)(6) (as determined under \u00a7 217.152), and each equity exposure to an investment fund (as determined under \u00a7 217.154); and(2) The greater of:(i) The estimate of potential losses on the Board-regulated institution's equity exposures (other than equity exposures referenced in paragraph (d)(1) of this section) generated by the Board-regulated institution's internal equity exposure model multiplied by 12.5; or(ii) The sum of:(A) 200 percent multiplied by the aggregate adjusted carrying value of the Board-regulated institution's publicly traded equity exposures that do not belong to a hedge pair, do not qualify for a 0 percent, 20 percent, or 100 percent risk weight under \u00a7 217.152(b)(1) through (b)(3)(i), and are not equity exposures to an investment fund; and(B) 200 percent multiplied by the aggregate ineffective portion of all hedge pairs.", "section_metadata": {"chapter_title": "CHAPTER II\u2014FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM", "chapter_id": "II", "volume_title": "PART 217\u2014CAPITAL ADEQUACY OF BANK HOLDING COMPANIES, SAVINGS AND LOAN HOLDING COMPANIES, AND STATE MEMBER BANKS (REGULATION Q)", "volume_id": "217", "section_id": "217.153", "section_title": "\u00a7 217.153 Internal models approach (IMA).", "unique_id": "II.217.153"}}

In supervising the activities of bank holding companies, the Board has adopted and continues to follow the principle that bank holding companies should serve as a source of strength for their subsidiary banks. Accordingly, the Board believes that any positions that bank holding companies or their nonbank subsidiaries take in financial contracts should reduce risk exposure, that is, not be speculative.(b) Establishment of prudent written policies, appropriate limitations and internal controls and audit programs. If the parent organization or nonbank subsidiary is taking or intends to take positions in financial contracts, that company's board of directors should approve prudent written policies and establish appropriate limitations to insure that financial contract activities are performed in a safe and sound manner with levels of activity reasonably related to the organization's business needs and capacity to fulfill obligations. In addition, internal controls and internal audit programs to monitor such activity should be established. The board of directors, a duly authorized committee thereof or the internal auditors should review periodically (at least monthly) all financial contract positions to insure conformity with such policies and limits. In order to determine the company's exposure, all open positions should be reviewed and market values determined at least monthly, or more often, depending on volume and magnitude of positions.(c) Formulating policies and recording financial contracts. In formulating its policies and procedures, the parent holding company may consider the interest rate exposure of its nonbank subsidiaries, but not that of its bank subsidiaries. As a matter of policy, the Board believes that any financial contracts executed to reduce the interest rate exposure of a bank affiliate of a holding company should be reflected on the books and records of the bank affiliate (to the extent required by the bank policy statements), rather than on the books and records of the parent company. If a bank has an interest rate exposure that management believes requires hedging with financial contracts, the bank should be the direct beneficiary of any effort to reduce that exposure. The Board also believes that final responsibility for financial contract transactions for the account of each affiliated bank should reside with the management of that bank.(d) Accounting. The joint bank policy statements of March 12, 1980 include accounting guidelines for banks that engage in financial contract activities. Since the Financial Accounting Standards Board is presently considering accounting standards for contract activities, no specific accounting requirements for financial contracts entered into by parent bank holding companies and nonbank subsidiaries are being mandated at this time. The Board expects to review further developments in this area.(e) Board to monitor bank holding company transactions in financial contracts. The Board intends to monitor closely bank holding company transactions in financial contracts to ensure that any such activity is consistent with maintaining a safe and sound banking system. In any cases where bank holding companies are found to be engaging in speculative practices, the Board is prepared to institute appropriate action under the Financial Institutions Supervisory Act of 1966, as amended.(f) Federal Reserve Bank notification. Bank holding companies should furnish written notification to their District Federal Reserve Bank within 10 days after financial contract activities are begun by the parent or a nonbank subsidiary. Holding companies in which the parent or a nonbank subsidiary currently engage in financial contract activity should furnish notice by March 31, 1983.(Secs. 5(b) and 8 of the Bank Holding Company Act (12 U.S.C. 1844 and 1847); sec. 8(b) of the Financial Institutions Supervisory Act (12 U.S.C. 1818(b)) [48 FR 7720, Feb. 24, 1983] ", "section_metadata": {"chapter_title": "CHAPTER II\u2014FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM", "chapter_id": "II", "volume_title": "PART 225\u2014BANK HOLDING COMPANIES AND CHANGE IN BANK CONTROL (REGULATION Y)", "volume_id": "225", "section_id": "225.142", "section_title": "\u00a7 225.142 Statement of policy concerning bank holding companies engaging in futures, forward and options contracts on U.S. Government and agency securities and money market instruments.", "unique_id": "II.225.142"}}

(1) Except for exposures that are deducted from common equity tier 1 capital and exposures subject to \u00a7 3.42(h), if a national bank or Federal savings association is unable to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the OCC a comprehensive understanding of the features of a securitization exposure that would materially affect the performance of the exposure, the national bank or Federal savings association must assign the securitization exposure a risk weight of 1,250 percent. The national bank's or Federal savings association's analysis must be commensurate with the complexity of the securitization exposure and the materiality of the exposure in relation to its capital.(2) A national bank or Federal savings association must demonstrate its comprehensive understanding of a securitization exposure under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, for each securitization exposure by:(i) Conducting an analysis of the risk characteristics of a securitization exposure prior to acquiring the exposure, and documenting such analysis within three business days after acquiring the exposure, considering:(A) Structural features of the securitization that would materially impact the performance of the exposure, for example, the contractual cash flow waterfall, waterfall-related triggers, credit enhancements, liquidity enhancements, fair value triggers, the performance of organizations that service the exposure, and deal-specific definitions of default;(B) Relevant information regarding the performance of the underlying credit exposure(s), for example, the percentage of loans 30, 60, and 90 days past due; default rates; prepayment rates; loans in foreclosure; property types; occupancy; average credit score or other measures of creditworthiness; average LTV ratio; and industry and geographic diversification data on the underlying exposure(s);(C) Relevant market data of the securitization, for example, bid-ask spread, most recent sales price and historic price volatility, trading volume, implied market rating, and size, depth and concentration level of the market for the securitization; and(D) For resecuritization exposures, performance information on the underlying securitization exposures, for example, the issuer name and credit quality, and the characteristics and performance of the exposures underlying the securitization exposures; and(ii) On an on-going basis (no less frequently than quarterly), evaluating, reviewing, and updating as appropriate the analysis required under paragraph (c)(1) of this section for each securitization exposure.", "section_metadata": {"chapter_title": "CHAPTER I\u2014COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY, DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY", "chapter_id": "I", "volume_title": "PART 3\u2014CAPITAL ADEQUACY STANDARDS", "volume_id": "3", "section_id": "3.41", "section_title": "\u00a7 3.41 Operational requirements for securitization exposures.", "unique_id": "I.3.41"}}

The term \u201cinterest\u201d as used in 12 U.S.C. 1463(g) includes any payment compensating a creditor or prospective creditor for an extension of credit, making available of a line of credit, or any default or breach by a borrower of a condition upon which credit was extended. It includes, among other things, the following fees connected with credit extension or availability: numerical periodic rates, late fees, not sufficient funds (NSF) fees, overlimit fees, annual fees, cash advance fees, and membership fees. It does not ordinarily include appraisal fees, premiums and commissions attributable to insurance guaranteeing repayment of any extension of credit, finders' fees, fees for document preparation or notarization, or fees incurred to obtain credit reports.(b) Authority. A savings association located in a state may charge interest at the maximum rate permitted to any state-chartered or licensed lending institution by the law of that state. If state law permits different interest charges on specified classes of loans, a Federal savings association making such loans is subject only to the provisions of state law relating to that class of loans that are material to the determination of the permitted interest. For example, a Federal savings association may lawfully charge the highest rate permitted to be charged by a state-licensed small loan company, without being so licensed, but subject to state law limitations on the size of loans made by small loan companies. State supervisors determine the degree to which state-chartered savings associations must comply with state laws other than those imposing restrictions on interest, as defined in paragraph (a) of this section.(c) Effect on state definitions of interest. The Federal definition of the term \u201cinterest\u201d in paragraph (a) of this section does not change how interest is defined by the individual states (nor how the state definition of interest is used) solely for purposes of state law. For example, if late fees are not \u201cinterest\u201d under state law where a savings association is located but state law permits its most favored lender to charge late fees, then a savings association located in that state may charge late fees to its intrastate customers. The savings association may also charge late fees to its interstate customers because the fees are interest under the Federal definition of interest and an allowable charge under state law where the savings association is located. However, the late fees would not be treated as interest for purposes of evaluating compliance with state usury limitations because state law excludes late fees when calculating the maximum interest that lending institutions may charge under those limitations.(d) Transferred loans. Interest on a loan that is permissible under 12 U.S.C. 1463(g)(1) shall not be affected by the sale, assignment, or other transfer of the loan.[76 FR 49030, Aug. 9, 2011, as amended at 85 FR 33536, June 2, 2020] ", "section_metadata": {"chapter_title": "CHAPTER I\u2014COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY, DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY", "chapter_id": "I", "volume_title": "PART 160\u2014LENDING AND INVESTMENT", "volume_id": "160", "section_id": "160.110", "section_title": "\u00a7 160.110 Most favored lender usury preemption for all savings associations.", "unique_id": "I.160.110"}}

This is described in paragraph (b)(3) of the regulation text.", "context": "\u00a7 204.121 Bankers' banks.(a)(1) The Federal Reserve Act, as amended by the Monetary Control Act of 1980 (title I of Pub. L. 96-221), imposes Federal reserve requirements on depository institutions that maintain transaction accounts or nonpersonal time deposits. Under section 19(b)(9), however, a depository institution is not required to maintain reserves if it:(i) Is organized solely to do business with other financial institutions;(ii) Is owned primarily by the financial institutions with which it does business; and(iii) Does not do business with the general public.Depository institutions that satisfy all of these requirements are regarded as bankers' banks.(2) In its application of these requirements to specific institutions, the Board will use the following standards:(i) A depository institution may be regarded as organized solely to do business with other depository institutions even if, as an incidental part to its activities, it does business to a limited extent with entities other than depository institutions. The extent to which the institution may do business with other entities and continue to be regarded as a bankers' bank is specified in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section.(ii) A depository institution will be regarded as being owned primarily by the institutions with which it does business if 75 per cent or more of its capital is owned by other depository institutions. The 75 per cent or more ownership rule applies regardless of the type of depository institution.(iii) A depository institution will not be regarded as doing business with the general public if it meets two conditions. First, the range of customers with which the institution does business must be limited to depository institutions, including subsidiaries or organizations owned by depository institutions; directors, officers or employees of the same or other depository institutions; individuals whose accounts are acquired at the request of the institution's supervisory authority due to the actual or impending failure of another depository institution; share insurance funds; depository institution trade associations; and such others as the Board may determine on a case-by-case basis consistent with the purposes of the Act and the bankers' bank exemption. Second, the extent to which the depository institution makes loans to, or investments in, the above entities (other than depository institutions) cannot exceed 10 per cent of total assets, and the extent to which it receives deposits (or shares if the institution does not receive deposits) from or issues other liabilities to the above entities (other than depository institutions) cannot exceed 10 per cent of total liabilities (or net worth if the institution does not receive deposits).If a depository institution is unable to meet all of these requirements on a continuing basis, it will not be regarded as a bankers' bank and will be required to satisfy Federal reserve requirements on all of its transaction accounts and nonpersonal time deposits. (b) (1) Section 19(c)(1) of the Federal Reserve Act, as amended by the Monetary Control Act of 1980 (title I of Pub. L. 96-221) provides that Federal reserve requirements may be satisfied by the maintenance of vault cash or balances in a Federal Reserve Bank. Depository institutions that are not members of the Federal Reserve System may also satisfy reserve requirements by maintaining a balance in another depository institution that maintains required reserve balances at a Federal Reserve Bank, in a Federal Home Loan Bank, or in the National Credit Union Administration Central Liquidity Facility if the balances maintained by such institutions are subsequently passed through to the Federal Reserve Bank.(2) On August 27, 1980, the Board announced the procedures that will apply to such pass-through arrangements (45 FR 58099). Section 204.3(i)(1) provides that the Board may permit, on a case-by-case basis, depository institutions that are not themselves required to maintain reserves (bankers' banks) to act as pass-through correspondents if certain criteria are satisfied. The Board has determined that a bankers' bank may act as a pass-through correspondent if it enters into an agreement with the Federal Reserve to accept responsibility for the maintenance of pass-through reserve accounts in accordance with Regulation D (12 CFR 204.3(i)) and if the Federal Reserve is satisfied that the quality of management and financial resources of the institution are adequate in order to enable the institution to serve as a pass-through correspondent in accordance with Regulation D. Satisfaction of these criteria will assure that pass-through arrangements are maintained properly without additional financial risk to the Federal Reserve.(3) In order to determine uniformly the adequacy of managerial and financial resources, the Board will consult with the Federal supervisor for the type of institution under consideration. Because the Board does not possess direct experience with supervising depository institutions other than commercial banks, and does not intend to involve itself in the direct supervision of such institutions, it will request the National Credit Union Administration to review requests from credit unions that qualify as bankers' banks and the Federal Home Loan Bank Board to review requests from savings and loan associations that qualify as bankers' banks, regardless of charter or insurance status. (The Board, itself, will consider requests from all commercial banks that qualify as bankers' banks.) If the Federal supervisor does not find the institution's managerial or financial resources to be adequate, the Board will not permit the institution to act as a pass-through correspondent. In order to assure the continued adequacy of managerial and financial resources, it is anticipated that the appropriate Federal supervisor will, on a periodic basis, review and evaluate the managerial and financial resources of the institution in order to determine whether it should continue to be permitted to act as a pass-through correspondent. It is anticipated that, with respect to state chartered institutions, the Federal supervisor may discuss the request with the institute State supervisor. The Board believes that this procedure will promote uniformity of treatment for all types of bankers' banks, and provide consistent advice concerning managerial ability and financial strength from supervisory authorities that are in a better position to evaluate these criteria for depository institutions that are not commercial banks.(4) Requests for a determination as to whether a depository institution will be regarded as a bankers' bank for purposes of the Federal Reserve Act or for permission to act as a pass-through correspondent may be addressed to the Federal Reserve Bank in whose District the main office of the depository institution is located or to the Secretary, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Washington, DC 20551. The Board will act promptly on all requests received directly or through Federal Reserve Banks.[45 FR 69879, Oct. 22, 1980, as amended by Reg.

In other cases depository institutions net positive balances in some trust accounts against negative balances in other trust accounts, thus reducing the balance in the commingled account and lowering the reserve requirements. Except in limited circumstances, negative balances in individual trust accounts should not be netted against positive balances in other trust accounts when determining the balance in a trust department's commingled transaction account maintained in a depository institution's commercial department. The netting of positive and negative balances has the effect of reducing the aggregate of a commingled transaction account reported by the depository institution to the Federal Reserve and reduces the reserves the institution must hold against transaction accounts under Regulation D. Unless the governing trust agreement or state law authorizes the depository institution, as trustee, to lend money in one trust to another trust, the negative balances in effect, for purposes of Regulation D, represent a loan from the depository institution. Consequently, negative balances in individual trust accounts should not be netted against positive balances in other individual trust accounts, and the balance in any transaction account containing commingled trust balances should reflect positive or zero balances for each individual trust.(2) For example, where a trust department engages in securities lending activities for trust accounts, overdrafts might occur because of the trust department's attempt to \u201cnormalize\u201d the effects of timing delays between the depository institution's receipt of the cash collateral from the broker and the trust department's posting of the transaction to the lending trust account. When securities are lent from a trust customer to a broker that pledges cash as collateral, the broker usually transfers the cash collateral to the depository institution on the day that the securities are made available. While the institution has the use of the funds from the time of the transfer, the trust department's normal posting procedures may not reflect receipt of the cash collateral by the individual account until the next day. On the day that the loan is terminated, the broker returns the securities to the lending trust account and the trust customer's account is debited for the amount of the cash collateral that is returned by the depository institution to the broker. The trust department, however, often does not liquidate the investment made with the cash collateral until the day after the loan terminates, a delay that normally causes a one day overdraft in the trust account. Regulation D requires that, on the day the loan is terminated, the depository institution regard the negative balance in the customer's account as zero for reserve requirement reporting purposes and not net the overdraft against positive balances in other accounts.(c) Procedures. In order to meet the requirements of Regulation D, a depository institution must have procedures to determine the aggregate of trust department transaction account balances for Regulation D on a daily basis. The procedures must consider only the positive balances in individual trust accounts without netting negative balances except in those limited circumstances where loans are legally permitted from one trust to another, or where offsetting is permitted pursuant to trust law or written agreement, or where the amount that caused the overdraft is still available in a settlement, suspense or other trust account within the trust department and may be used to offset the overdraft.[57 FR 38429, Aug. 25, 1992] ", "section_metadata": {"chapter_title": "CHAPTER II\u2014FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM", "chapter_id": "II", "volume_title": "PART 204\u2014RESERVE REQUIREMENTS OF DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS (REGULATION D)", "volume_id": "204", "section_id": "204.136", "section_title": "\u00a7 204.136 Treatment of trust overdrafts for reserve requirement reporting purposes.", "unique_id": "II.204.136"}}

Hence, loans made to enable consumers to purchase automobiles or other goods should be included under commercial, agricultural, and industrial paper within the meaning of the Federal Reserve Act, and as such are eligible for discounting with the Reserve Banks and as security for advances from the Reserve Banks under section 13, paragraph 8, of the Federal Reserve Act as long as they conform to requirements with respect to maturity and other matters. This applies equally to loans made directly by banks to consumers and to paper accepted by banks from dealers or finance companies. It also applies to notes of finance companies themselves as long as the proceeds of such notes are used to finance the purchase of consumer goods or for other purposes which are eligible within the meaning of the Federal Reserve Act.(d) If there is any question as to whether the proceeds of a note of a finance company have been or are to be used for a commercial, agricultural, or industrial purpose, a financial statement of the finance company reflecting an excess of notes receivable which appear eligible for rediscount (without regard to maturity) over total current liabilities (i.e., notes due within 1 year) may be taken as an indication of eligibility.

In addition, that language should be regarded as including notes given for the purchase of mobile homes that are acquired by a finance company from a dealer-seller of such homes.(e) The principles stated above apply not only to notes of a finance company engaged in making consumer loans but also to notes of a finance company engaged in making loans for other eligible purposes, including business and agricultural loans. Under section 13a of the Federal Reserve Act, paper representing loans to finance the production, marketing, and carrying of agricultural products or the breeding, raising, fattening, or marketing of livestock is eligible for discount if the paper has a maturity of not exceeding 9 months. Consequently, a note of a finance company the proceeds of which are used by it to make loans for such purposes is eligible for discount or as security for a Federal Reserve advance, and such a note, unlike the note of a finance company making consumer loans, may have a maturity of up to 9 months.[37 FR 4701, Mar. 4, 1972] ", "section_metadata": {"chapter_title": "CHAPTER II\u2014FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM", "chapter_id": "II", "volume_title": "PART 201\u2014EXTENSIONS OF CREDIT BY FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS (REGULATION A)", "volume_id": "201", "section_id": "201.104", "section_title": "\u00a7 201.104 Eligibility of consumer loans and finance company paper.", "unique_id": "II.201.104"}}

In 1982, the Board issued an interpretation concerning the effect of a member bank's purchase of its own time deposits in the secondary market in order to ensure compliance with regulatory restrictions on the payment of interest on time deposits, with the prohibition against payment of interest on demand deposits, and with regulatory requirements designed to distinguish between time deposits and demand deposits for federal reserve requirement purposes (47 FR 37878, Aug. 27, 1982). The interpretation was designed to ensure that the regulatory early withdrawal penalties in Regulation Q used to achieve these three purposes were not evaded through the purchase by a member bank or its affiliate of a time deposit of the member bank prior to the maturity of the deposit.(b) Because the expiration of the Depository Institutions Deregulation Act (title II of Pub. L. 96-221) on April 1, 1986, removed the authority to set interest rate ceilings on deposits, one of the purposes for adopting the interpretation was eliminated. The removal of the authority to set interest rate ceilings on deposits required the Board to revise the early withdrawal penalties which were also used to distinguish between types of deposits for reserve requirement purposes. Effective April 1, 1986, the Board amended its Regulation D to incorporate early withdrawal penalties applicable to all depository institutions for this purpose (51 FR 9629, Mar. 20, 1986). Although the new early withdrawal penalties differ from the penalties used to enforce interest rate ceilings, secondary market purchases still effectively shorten the maturities of deposits and may be used to evade reserve requirements. This interpretation replaces the prior interpretation and states the application of the new early withdrawal penalties to purchases by depository institutions and their affiliates of the depository institution's time deposits. The interpretation applies only to situations in which the Board's regulatory penalties apply.(c) Secondary market purchases under the rule. The Board has determined that a depository institution purchasing a time deposit it has issued should be regarded as having paid the time deposit prior to maturity. The effect of the transaction is that the depository institution has cancelled a liability as opposed to having acquired an asset for its portfolio. Thus, the depository institution is required to impose any early withdrawal penalty required by Regulation D on the party from whom it purchases the instrument by deducting the amount of the penalty from the purchase price. The Board recognizes, however, that secondary market sales of time deposits are often done without regard to the identity of the original owner of the deposit. Such sales typically involve a pool of time deposits with the price based on the aggregate face value and average rate of return on the deposits. A depository institution purchasing time deposits from persons other than the person to whom the deposit was originally issued should be aware of the parties named on each of the deposits it is purchasing but through failure to inspect the deposits prior to the purchase may not be aware at the time it purchases a pool of time deposits that it originally issued one or more of the deposits in the pool. In such cases, if a purchasing depository institution does not wish to assess an applicable early withdrawal penalty, the deposit may be sold immediately in the secondary market as an alternative to imposing the early withdrawal penalty.(d) Purchases by affiliates. On a consolidated basis, if an affiliate (as defined in \u00a7 204.2(q) of Regulation D) of a depository institution purchases a CD issued by the depository institution, the purchase does not reduce their consolidated liabilities and could be accomplished primarily to assist the depository institution in avoiding the requirements of the Board's Regulation D. Because the effect of the early withdrawal penalty rule could be easily circumvented by purchases of time deposits by affiliates, such purchases are also regarded as an early withdrawals of the time deposit, and the purchase should be treated as if the depository institution made the purchase directly. Thus, the regulatory requirements for early withdrawal penalties apply to affiliates of a depository institution as well as to the institution itself.(e) Depository institution acting as broker. The Board believes that it is permissible for a depository institution to facilitate the secondary market for its own time deposits by finding a purchaser for a time deposit that a customer is trying to sell. In such instances, the depository institution will not be paying out any of its own funds, and the depositor does not have a guarantee that the depository institution will actually be able to find a buyer.(f) Third-party market-makers. A depository institution may also establish and advertise arrangements whereby an unaffiliated third party agrees in advance to purchase time deposits issued by the institution. The Board would not regard these transactions as inconsistent with the purposes that the early withdrawal penalty is intended to serve unless a depository institution pays a fee to the third party purchaser as compensation for making the purchases or to remove the risk from purchasing the deposits.

Except as indicated in this paragraph (a)(1) or as provided in \u00a7 330.3(j), in determining the amount of insurance available to each depositor, the FDIC shall presume that deposited funds are actually owned in the manner indicated on the deposit account records of the insured depository institution. If the FDIC, in its sole discretion, determines that the deposit account records of the insured depository institution are clear and unambiguous, those records shall be considered binding on the depositor, and the FDIC shall consider no other records on the manner in which the funds are owned. If the deposit account records are ambiguous or unclear on the manner in which the funds are owned, then the FDIC may, in its sole discretion, consider evidence other than the deposit account records of the insured depository institution for the purpose of establishing the manner in which the funds are owned. Despite the general requirements of this paragraph (a)(1), if the FDIC has reason to believe that the insured depository institution's deposit account records misrepresent the actual ownership of deposited funds and such misrepresentation would increase deposit insurance coverage, the FDIC may consider all available evidence and pay claims for insured deposits on the basis of the actual rather than the misrepresented ownership.(2) Recognition of deposit ownership in custodial accounts. In the case of custodial deposits, the interest of each beneficial owner may be determined on a fractional or percentage basis. This may be accomplished in any manner which indicates that where the funds of an owner are commingled with other funds held in a custodial capacity and a portion thereof is placed on deposit in one or more insured depository institutions without allocation, the owner's insured interest in the deposit in any one insured depository institution would represent, at any given time, the same fractional share as his or her share of the total commingled funds.(b) Fiduciary relationships\u2014(1) Recognition. The FDIC will recognize a claim for insurance coverage based on a fiduciary relationship only if the relationship is expressly disclosed, by way of specific references, in the \u201cdeposit account records\u201d (as defined in \u00a7 330.1(e)) of the insured depository institution. Such relationships include, but are not limited to, relationships involving a trustee, agent, nominee, guardian, executor or custodian pursuant to which funds are deposited. The express indication that the account is held in a fiduciary capacity will not be necessary, however, in instances where the FDIC determines, in its sole discretion, that the titling of the deposit account and the underlying deposit account records sufficiently indicate the existence of a fiduciary relationship. This exception may apply, for example, where the deposit account title or records indicate that the account is held by an escrow agent, title company or a company whose business is to hold deposits and securities for others.(2) Details of fiduciary relationships. If the deposit account records of an insured depository institution disclose the existence of a relationship which might provide a basis for additional insurance (including the exception provided for in paragraph (b)(1) of this section), the details of the relationship and the interests of other parties in the account must be ascertainable either from the deposit account records of the insured depository institution or from records maintained, in good faith and in the regular course of business, by the depositor or by some person or entity that has undertaken to maintain such records for the depositor.(3) Multi-tiered fiduciary relationships. In deposit accounts where there are multiple levels of fiduciary relationships, there are two methods of satisfying paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section to obtain insurance coverage for the interests of the true beneficial owners of a deposit account.(i) One method is to:(A) Expressly indicate, on the deposit account records of the insured depository institution, the existence of each and every level of fiduciary relationships; and(B) Disclose, at each level, the name(s) and interest(s) of the person(s) on whose behalf the party at that level is acting.(ii) An alternative method is to:(A) Expressly indicate, on the deposit account records of the insured depository institution, that there are multiple levels of fiduciary relationships;(B) Disclose the existence of additional levels of fiduciary relationships in records, maintained in good faith and in the regular course of business, by parties at subsequent levels; and(C) Disclose, at each of the levels, the name(s) and interest(s) of the person(s) on whose behalf the party at that level is acting. No person or entity in the chain of parties will be permitted to claim that they are acting in a fiduciary capacity for others unless the possible existence of such a relationship is revealed at some previous level in the chain.(4) Exceptions\u2014(i) Deposits evidenced by negotiable instruments. If any deposit obligation of an insured depository institution is evidenced by a negotiable certificate of deposit, negotiable draft, negotiable cashier's or officer's check, negotiable certified check, negotiable traveler's check, letter of credit or other negotiable instrument, the FDIC will recognize the owner of such deposit obligation for all purposes of claim for insured deposits to the same extent as if his or her name and interest were disclosed on the records of the insured depository institution; provided, that the instrument was in fact negotiated to such owner prior to the date of default of the insured depository institution. The owner must provide affirmative proof of such negotiation, in a form satisfactory to the FDIC, to substantiate his or her claim. Receipt of a negotiable instrument directly from the insured depository institution in default shall, in no event, be considered a negotiation of said instrument for purposes of this provision.(ii) Deposit obligations for payment of items forwarded for collection by depository institution acting as agent. Where an insured depository institution in default has become obligated for the payment of items forwarded for collection by a depository institution acting solely as agent, the FDIC will recognize the holders of such items for all purposes of claim for insured deposits to the same extent as if their name(s) and interest(s) were disclosed as depositors on the deposit account records of the insured depository institution, when such claim for insured deposits, if otherwise payable, has been established by the execution and delivery of prescribed forms. The FDIC will recognize such depository institution forwarding such items for the holders thereof as agent for such holders for the purpose of making an assignment to the FDIC of their rights against the insured depository institution in default and for the purpose of receiving payment on their behalf.[63 FR 25756, May 11, 1998, as amended at 64 FR 15656, Apr. 1, 1999] ", "section_metadata": {"chapter_title": "CHAPTER III\u2014FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION", "chapter_id": "III", "volume_title": "PART 330\u2014DEPOSIT INSURANCE COVERAGE", "volume_id": "330", "section_id": "330.5", "section_title": "\u00a7 330.5 Recognition of deposit ownership and fiduciary relationships.", "unique_id": "III.330.5"}}

This is stated in the first sentence of paragraph (a) of the regulation.", "context": "\u00a7 3.144 Simplified supervisory formula approach (SSFA).(a) General requirements for the SSFA. To use the SSFA to determine the risk weight for a securitization exposure, a national bank or Federal savings association must have data that enables it to assign accurately the parameters described in paragraph (b) of this section. Data used to assign the parameters described in paragraph (b) of this section must be the most currently available data; if the contracts governing the underlying exposures of the securitization require payments on a monthly or quarterly basis, the data used to assign the parameters described in paragraph (b) of this section must be no more than 91 calendar days old. A national bank or Federal savings association that does not have the appropriate data to assign the parameters described in paragraph (b) of this section must assign a risk weight of 1,250 percent to the exposure.(b) SSFA parameters. To calculate the risk weight for a securitization exposure using the SSFA, a national bank or Federal savings association must have accurate information on the following five inputs to the SSFA calculation:(1) KG is the weighted-average (with unpaid principal used as the weight for each exposure) total capital requirement of the underlying exposures calculated using subpart D of this part. KG is expressed as a decimal value between zero and one (that is, an average risk weight of 100 percent represents a value of KG equal to 0.08).(2) Parameter W is expressed as a decimal value between zero and one. Parameter W is the ratio of the sum of the dollar amounts of any underlying exposures of the securitization that meet any of the criteria as set forth in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (vi) of this section to the balance, measured in dollars, of underlying exposures:(i) Ninety days or more past due;(ii) Subject to a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding;(iii) In the process of foreclosure;(iv) Held as real estate owned;(v) Has contractually deferred payments for 90 days or more, other than principal or interest payments deferred on:(A) Federally-guaranteed student loans, in accordance with the terms of those guarantee programs; or(B) Consumer loans, including non-federally-guaranteed student loans, provided that such payments are deferred pursuant to provisions included in the contract at the time funds are disbursed that provide for period(s) of deferral that are not initiated based on changes in the creditworthiness of the borrower; or(vi) Is in default.(3) Parameter A is the attachment point for the exposure, which represents the threshold at which credit losses will first be allocated to the exposure. Except as provided in section 142(l) for nth-to-default credit derivatives, parameter A equals the ratio of the current dollar amount of underlying exposures that are subordinated to the exposure of the national bank or Federal savings association to the current dollar amount of underlying exposures. Any reserve account funded by the accumulated cash flows from the underlying exposures that is subordinated to the national bank's or Federal savings association's securitization exposure may be included in the calculation of parameter A to the extent that cash is present in the account. Parameter A is expressed as a decimal value between zero and one.(4) Parameter D is the detachment point for the exposure, which represents the threshold at which credit losses of principal allocated to the exposure would result in a total loss of principal. Except as provided in section 142(l) for nth-to-default credit derivatives, parameter D equals parameter A plus the ratio of the current dollar amount of the securitization exposures that are pari passu with the exposure (that is, have equal seniority with respect to credit risk) to the current dollar amount of the underlying exposures. Parameter D is expressed as a decimal value between zero and one.(5) A supervisory calibration parameter, p, is equal to 0.5 for securitization exposures that are not resecuritization exposures and equal to 1.5 for resecuritization exposures.(c) Mechanics of the SSFA. KG and W are used to calculate KA, the augmented value of KG, which reflects the observed credit quality of the underlying exposures. KA is defined in paragraph (d) of this section.

This section describes OCC procedures and approval standards for an application or a notice by a national bank to change the location of its main office or by a Federal savings association to change the location of its home office. 3 A national bank or Federal savings association must follow the procedures described in paragraph (c) of this section to relocate its main office or home office, as applicable.3 A national bank's main office is the place identified in the bank's original organization certificate under 12 U.S.C. 22 or the subsequent location to which the main office has been changed under this \u00a7 5.40, 12 U.S.C. 30(b), or other applicable law, as reflected in the national bank's amended articles of association. A Federal savings association's home office is the office identified as such in the savings association's original charter or the subsequent location to which the home office has been changed under this \u00a7 5.40, or other applicable law, as reflected in the savings association's amended charter.

A national bank or Federal savings association may change the location of its main office or home office, as applicable, to an authorized branch location (approved or existing branch site) within the limits of the same city, town, or village. The national bank or Federal savings association must give prior notice to the appropriate OCC licensing office before the relocation. The notice must include the new address of the main office or home office, as applicable, and the effective date of the relocation.(2) To any other location\u2014(i) National banks. A national bank must submit an application to the appropriate OCC licensing office and obtain prior OCC approval to relocate its main office to any other location in the city, town, or village in which the main office of the bank is located other than an authorized branch location or to any other location within 30 miles of the limits of such city, town, or village. If relocating the main office outside the limits of its city, town, or village, a national bank must also obtain the approval of shareholders owning two-thirds of the voting stock of the bank and must amend its articles of association.(ii) Federal savings associations. A Federal savings association must submit an application to the appropriate OCC licensing office and obtain prior OCC approval to relocate its home office to any location other than an authorized branch location within the city, town, or village in which the home office of the savings association is located. If relocating the home office outside the limits of its city, town, or village, a Federal savings association must obtain any shareholder or member approval required under its charter for such relocation and must amend its charter.(3) Establishment of a branch at site of former main office or home office. A national bank or Federal savings association desiring to establish a branch at its former main office or home office location, as applicable, must follow the provisions of \u00a7 5.30 or \u00a7 5.31, respectively.(4) Expedited review. A main office or home office relocation application submitted by an eligible bank or eligible savings association under paragraph (c)(2) of this section is deemed approved by the OCC as of the 15th day after the close of the public comment period or the 45th day after the filing is received by the OCC (or in the case of a short-distance relocation the 30th day after the filing is received by the OCC), whichever is later, unless the OCC notifies the bank or savings association prior to that time that the filing has been removed from expedited review, or the expedited review period is extended, under \u00a7 5.13(a)(2).(5) Exceptions to rules of general applicability. (i) Sections 5.8, 5.9, 5.10, and 5.11 do not apply to a main office or home office relocation to an authorized branch location within the limits of the city, town, or village as described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. However, if the OCC concludes that the notice under paragraph (c)(1) of this section presents a significant or novel policy, supervisory, or legal issue, the OCC may determine that any or all parts of \u00a7\u00a7 5.8, 5.9, 5.10, and 5.11 apply.(ii) The comment period on any application filed under paragraph (c)(2) of this section to engage in a short-distance relocation of a main office or home office is 15 days.(d) Expiration of approval. Approval expires if the national bank or Federal savings association has not opened its main office or home office, as applicable, at the relocated site within 18 months of the date of approval, unless the OCC grants an extension.[80 FR 28452, May 18, 2015, as amended at 85 FR 80462, Dec. 11, 2020] ", "section_metadata": {"chapter_title": "CHAPTER I\u2014COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY, DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY", "chapter_id": "I", "volume_title": "PART 5\u2014RULES, POLICIES, AND PROCEDURES FOR CORPORATE ACTIVITIES", "volume_id": "5", "section_id": "5.40", "section_title": "\u00a7 5.40 Change in location of a main office of a national bank or home office of a Federal savings association.", "unique_id": "I.5.40"}}
