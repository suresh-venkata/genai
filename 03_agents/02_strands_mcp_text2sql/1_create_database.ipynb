    "## Wealth Management SQL Agent\n",
    "> *This notebook should work well with the **`Python 3 (ipykernel)`** kernel in SageMaker Studio on ml.t3.medium instance*\n",
    "\n",
    "In this set of labs we will explore how to build a SQL Agent using Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Strands agents.\n",
    "Key concepts include:\n",
    "- Ingesting data into a local [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/) database\n",
    "- Creating an [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro) Server to expose the database via an API\n",
    "- Creating a Wealth Management SQL Agent using [Strands Agents](https://strandsagents.com/latest/)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Case Overview\n",
    "In this use case we will build a Text-to-SQL agent that will serve two distinct personas:\n",
    "1. **Client**: A client who wants to ask questions about their portfolio For example:\n",
    "    - \"What is the current value of my portfolio?\"\n",
    "    - \"How much have I earned in the last month?\"\n",
    "    - \"What are my top performing assets?\"\n",
    "2. **Wealth Manager / Portfolio Analyst**: An analysts that can ask questions across all clients. For example:\n",
    "    - \"What is the average portfolio value across all clients?\"\n",
    "    - \"Which clients have significant positions in tech stocks?\"\n",
    "    - \"Which clients have a portfolio value above $1 million?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The same database and MCP server will be used for both personas, and we'll demonstrate some simple authorization mechanism that restricts access and capabilities based on the user's role.\n"
